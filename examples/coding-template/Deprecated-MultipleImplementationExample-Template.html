  This template is deprecated.
  As of November 21, 2016, the task force agrees that:
  * We will put one example per page.
  * Multiple examples on a page add complexity, create greater potential for confusion.
  * Priority is clarity and simplicity even if that creates some duplication of content.
  An example that was implemented with this template can be found in: examples/checkbox/checkbox-2.html.
  This template is for examples where multiple implementations of the same design pattern are demonstrated.
  This template includes space for 3 implementations; reduce or expand as needed.
  Use this template when multiple implementations are needed to demonstrate subtle but important variations in the design pattern.
  If you use this template file, rename it to reflect the name of the example, e.g., TriStateCheckboxes.html.
  Similarly, rename the javascript and CSS stub files in the js and css subdirectories and update the head element of this file.
-->

<!--  Give this example implementation a name and put it in the title element, e.g., "Checkbox" if implementing the checkbox pattern.
  The name should be unique if the pattern will have multiple implementations,
  e.g., "Simple Two-State Checkbox" or "Three-State Checkbox".

    Replace this text with an overview of the example that is something like the following.
    Following are three example implementations of the
    <a href="../../#checkbox">design pattern for checkbox</a>
    that demonstrate how to make a widget that uses the <code>mixed</code> value for <code>aria-checked</code>.
    These examples also show three different ways of labeling a collection of checkboxes so screen
    reader users can perceive that all members of the collection are part of a logical group.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the below examples, a set of checkboxes is used to choose condiments for a sandwich. The user
    can use the first checkbox, labeled "All Condiments", to quickly specify a desire for either all
    or none of the condiments. If the user chooses to have some but not all condiments, the "All
    Condiments" checkbox will reflect that state as "partially checked"; this is the <code>mixed</code>
    value of <code>aria-checked</code>.
