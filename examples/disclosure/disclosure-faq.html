  <h1>Example Disclosure (Show/Hide) for Answers to Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p>
    The following example demonstrates using the
    <a href="../../#disclosure">disclosure design pattern</a>
    to create a set of frequently asked questions where the answers may be independently shown or hidden.

    <h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The semantic structure of the FAQ is conveyed with native <code>dl</code>, <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> elements.
        To ensure  the list structure is communicated to assistive technologies, instead of applying a button role to the <code>dt</code> element, a <code>button</code> element is contained within the <code>dt</code> element.
        Similarly, each <code>div</code> element  containing  answer content that can be shown or hidden by the button is a child of a <code>dd</code> element.
        Since all the <code>dd</code> elements are present in the DOM even if some answers are hidden, the <code>dl</code> structure is always complete.
      </li>
      <li>
        To help people with visual impairments identify the disclosure as interactive and make it easier to perceive that clicking either the disclosure button or its label changes the expanded state, when a pointer hovers over the button or its label, the background color changes, a border appears, and the cursor changes to a pointer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because transparent borders are visible on some systems with operating system high contrast settings enabled, transparency cannot be used to create a visual difference between the element that is focused an other elements.
        Instead of using transparency, the focused element has a thicker border and less padding.
        When an element receives focus, its border changes from 0 to 2 pixels and padding is reduced by 2 pixels.
        When an element loses focus, its border changes from 2 pixels to 0 and padding is increased by 2 pixels.
      </li>
      <li>
        To ensure the inline SVG arrow graphics in the CSS have sufficient contrast with the background when high contrast settings invert colors, the color of the arrows are synchronized with the color of the text content.
        For example, the color of the arrow is set to match the foreground color of high contrast mode text by specifying the CSS <code>currentColor</code> value for the <code>stroke</code> and <code>fill</code> properties of the <code>polygon</code> elements used to draw the arrows.
        If specific colors were instead used to specify the <code>polygon</code> properties, those colors would remain the same in high contrast mode, which could lead to insufficient contrast between the arrows and the background or even make the arrows invisible if the color matched the high contrast mode background.<br>
        Note: The SVG element needs to have the CSS <code>forced-color-adjust</code> property set to <code>auto</code> for the <code>currentColor</code> value to be updated in high contrast mode.
        Some browsers do not use <code>auto</code> for the default value.
      </li>

                CSS attribute selectors (e.g. <code>[aria-expanded="false"]</code>) are

                The visual indicator of the show/hide state is created using CSS <code>:before</code> pseudo element and <code>content</code> property
                so the image is reliably rendered in high contrast mode of operating systems and browsers.
