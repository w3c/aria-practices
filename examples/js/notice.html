    <summary>Important Note About Use of This Example</summary>
    <p>
        Note: This is an illustrative example of one way of using ARIA that conforms with the ARIA specification.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        There may be support gaps in some
        <a href="/#browser_and_AT_support">browser and assistive technology combinations</a>,
        especially for <a href="/#mobile_and_touch_support">mobile/touch devices</a>.
        Testing code based on this example with assistive technologies is essential before considering use in production systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-at/">ARIA-AT project</a>
        plans to provide measurements of this example's assistive technology support by the end of 2020.
    </li>
    <li>
        Robust accessibility can be further optimized by choosing implementation patterns that
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1">maximize use of semantic HTML</a>
        and heeding the warning that
        <a href="/#no_aria_better_bad_aria">No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA</a>.
    </li>
    </ul>
