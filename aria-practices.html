    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) explains how to create accessible web experiences for users of assistive technologies and keyboard interfaces by developing web sites that properly convey accessibility semantics and implement common keyboard conventions.
      It also provides guidance on some closely related topics, such as supporting operating system settings for high contrast and reduced motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accessibility semantics refer to the meaning of user interface elements that need to be conveyed to assistive technology users in order for those users to understand and use the elements.
      For example, people who can visually perceive a search icon button understand the element can be activated to perform a search by the way it is styled and positioned.
      To make that icon accessible to a screen reader user, one of the semantics that needs to be communicated is that the element represents an interactive button.
      In addition, keyboard accessibility requires the button to be focusable, and keyboard conventions call for pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to activate the button when it is focused.
      The APG describes how to convey accessibility semantics and implement keyboard accessibility for many common design patterns, ranging from typical buttons and popup menus to complex tree grids.
      It also explains essential practices related to these patterns, such as how to convey web page structure with ARIA landmark regions and effectively utilize the many ways of encoding accessible names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The APG is organized into two major sections: patterns and practices.
      Each pattern explains how to make a common user interface element, such as a button, menu, or dialog, accessible, and provides functional example implementations of the pattern.
      The practices section gives in-depth explanation of how to satisfy a variety of accessibility needs that surface when making rich internet application experiences accessible.
      For instance, the practices section on providing accessible names and descriptions gives detailed descriptions of seven different naming techniques as well as a table providing guidance for naming more than 80 types of elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The APG assumes basic understanding of web development, especially of HTML and CSS.
      It may be particularly useful to designers and engineers who are working on site design systems and component libraries.
      However, it is important to understand that the APG only covers a portion of what is needed to create accessible experiences.
      To understand accessibility more broadly, it is advisable to start with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">WAI Accessibility Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/design-develop/">WAI Overview of Design and Development</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accessibility semantics used in the APG patterns and described in APG practices are defined in the
      <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/">WAI-ARIA 1.2 Specification</a></cite>.
      That is, the ARIA specification standardizes the meaning of the attributes that describe elements and their states to assistive technologies, such as the meaning of <code>role="button"</code>.
      These attributes and other features required to make sites usable by people who rely on assistive technologies or keyboard navigation are not natively included in the languages used to create web sites, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SVG.
      The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications working group (ARIA WG) is addressing these deficiencies through several W3C standards efforts.
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>
      provides additional background on WAI-ARIA, summarizes those efforts, and lists the other documents included in the WAI-ARIA suite.

    <h2>Read Me First</h2>
    <section id="no_aria_better_bad_aria">
      <h3>No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA</h3>
      <p>
        Functionally, ARIA roles, states, and properties are analogous to a CSS for assistive technologies.
        For screen reader users, ARIA controls the rendering of their non-visual experience.
        Incorrect ARIA misrepresents visual experiences, with potentially devastating effects on their corresponding non-visual experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Before using ARIA or any of the guidance in this document, please take time to understand the following two essential principles.</p>
      <h4>Principle 1: A role is a promise</h4>
      <p>This code:</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div role=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Place Order&lt;/div&gt;
          </code> </pre>
      <p>
        Is a promise that the author of that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has also incorporated JavaScript that provides the keyboard interactions expected for a button.
        Unlike HTML input elements, ARIA roles do not cause browsers to provide keyboard behaviors or styling.
      </p>
      <p>Using a role without fulfilling the promise of that role is similar to making a &quot;Place Order&quot; button that abandons an order and empties the shopping cart.</p>
      <p>One of the objectives of this guide is to define expected behaviors for each ARIA role.</p>
      <h4>Principle 2: ARIA Can Both Cloak and Enhance, Creating Both Power and Danger</h4>
      <p>
        The information assistive technologies need about the meaning and purpose of user interface elements is called accessibility semantics.
        From the perspective of assistive technologies, ARIA gives authors the ability to dress up HTML and SVG elements with critical accessibility semantics that the assistive technologies would not otherwise be able to reliably derive.
      </p>
      <p>Some of ARIA is like a cloak; it covers up, or overrides, the original semantics or content.</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;a role=&quot;menuitem&quot;&gt;Assistive tech users perceive this element as an item in a menu, not a link.&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a aria-label=&quot;Assistive tech users can only perceive the contents of this aria-label, not the link text&quot;&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>On the other hand, some uses of ARIA are more like suspenders or belts; they add meaning that provides essential support to the original content.</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;button aria-pressed=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Mute&lt;/button&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This is the power of ARIA.
        It enables authors to describe nearly any user interface component in ways that assistive technologies can reliably interpret, thus making components accessible to assistive technology users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also the danger of ARIA.
        Authors can inadvertently override accessibility semantics.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;table role=&quot;log&quot;&gt;
            &lt;!--
              Table that assistive technology users will not perceive as a table.
              The log role tells browser this is a log, not a table.
            --&gt;
          &lt;/table&gt;
          &lt;ul role=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
            &lt;!-- This is a navigation region, not a list. --&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;uri1&quot;&gt;nav link 1&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;uri2&quot;&gt;nav link 2&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;!-- ERROR! Previous list items are not in a list! --&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Browser and Assistive Technology Support</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Testing assistive technology interoperability is essential before using code from this guide in production.</strong>
        Because the purpose of this guide is to illustrate appropriate use of ARIA 1.2 as defined in the ARIA specification, the design patterns, reference examples, and sample code intentionally <strong>do not</strong> describe and implement coding techniques for working around problems caused by gaps in support for ARIA 1.2 in browsers and assistive technologies.
        It is thus advisable to test implementations thoroughly with each browser and assistive technology combination that is relevant within a target audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, JavaScript and CSS in this guide is written to be compatible with the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari at the time of writing.
Some JavaScript and CSS may not function correctly in Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except in cases where the ARIA Working Group and other contributors have overlooked an error,
        examples in this guide that do not function well in a particular browser or with a specific assistive technology are demonstrating browser or assistive technology bugs.
        Browser and assistive technology developers can thus utilize code in this guide to help assess the quality of their support for ARIA 1.2.

    <section id="mobile_and_touch_support">
      <h3>Mobile and Touch Support</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, this guide does not indicate which examples are compatible with mobile browsers or touch interfaces.
        While some of the examples include specific features that enhance mobile and touch support, some ARIA features are not supported in any mobile browser.
        In addition, there is not yet a standardized approach for providing touch interactions that work across mobile browsers.
      </p>
      <p>More guidance about touch and mobile support is planned for future releases of the guide.</p>

    <h2>Communicating Value and Limits for Range Widgets</h2>
    <p>
      ARIA defines the following roles as range widgets, which means they communicate a value that is typically numeric and constrained to defined limits.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>meter</code></li>
      <li><code>progressbar</code></li>
      <li><code>scrollbar</code></li>
      <li><code>separator</code> (if focusable)</li>
      <li><code>slider</code></li>
      <li><code>spinbutton</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, a spin button for choosing a day within the month of January would allow integer values that range from 1 to 31.
      In some cases, the value is represented numerically, but is not presented as a number to users.
      For instance, a spin button for choosing a day of the week could support values from 1 to 7 but they could be presented to the user as day names, e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section describes considerations for using the following four properties that communicate characteristics of a range widget:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Property</th>
          <th>Definition</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuemin</code></th>
          <td>Defines the minimum value allowed by a range widget.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuemax</code></th>
          <td>Defines the maximum value allowed by a range widget.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuenow</code></th>
          <td>Defines the current value of a range widget. This value is a number greater than or equal to <code>aria-valuemin</code> and less than or equal to <code>aria-valuemax</code> (if they are specified).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuetext</code></th>
          <td>If a numeric value is not sufficiently descriptive, this property can define a text description of the current value of a range widget.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <section id="range_related_properties_using_aria-valuemin_aria-valuemax_and_aria-valuenow">
      <h3>Using <code>aria-valuemin</code>, <code>aria-valuemax</code> and <code>aria-valuenow</code></h3>
      <p>
        When the value of a range widget is constrained to known limits, the <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> properties are used to inform assistive technologies of the minimum and maximum values of the range.
        For some widgets, assistive technologies use this information to present the current value as a percentage.
        When using these properties, set <code>aria-valuemin</code> to the lowest value allowed for the widget and <code>aria-valuemax</code> to the highest allowed value.
        If values for <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> are not set, default values are exposed to assistive technologies unless the widget is a <code>spinbutton</code>, which is the only range widget that does not have default limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>aria-valuenow</code> property is used to inform assistive technologies of the current value of a range widget.
        Set <code>aria-valuenow</code> to the current value of the widget, ensuring the value of <code>aria-valuenow</code> falls within the range defined by <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code>.
        If the current value of a <code>progressbar</code> or <code>spinbutton</code> is indeterminate or unknown, omit the <code>aria-valuenow</code> property.
        The <code>aria-valuenow</code> property is required for the <code>meter</code>, <code>scrollbar</code>, <code>separator</code> (if the element is focusable), and <code>slider</code> roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The range widget roles have the following default values and requirements for <code>aria-valuemin</code>, <code>aria-valuemax</code> and <code>aria-valuenow</code>.

        When the element's values are contained within a range but those values are not numeric (such as "small", "medium" and "large"),
        or they are numeric but there is value in communicating more information than just a number,
        <code>aria-valuetext</code> is used to surface the text value to assistive technologies.
        Only use <code>aria-valuetext</code> when <code>aria-valuenow</code> is not sufficiently meaningful for users because using <code>aria-valuetext</code> will prevent assistive technologies from communicating <code>aria-valuenow</code>.

          For example, for a battery indicator, it would be useful to know how many minutes are remaining, in addition to the percentage of charge remaining.

      <h3>Range properties with meter</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> properties only need to be set for elements with role <code>meter</code> if the meter's minimum value is not 0 or its maximum value is not 100.
        It is necessary, however, to always specify a value for <code>aria-valuenow</code> and to ensure the value is greater than or equal to the minimum allowed value and less than or equal to the maximum allowed value.
        A detailed description of the <code>meter</code> role is in the <a href="#meter">meter design pattern</a>.</p>

      <p>This example of a meter shows the current Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage. </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;span id="cpu_usage_label"&gt;CPU usage&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;!-- The CPU usage uses the default values of 0 and 100 for aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax --&gt;
&lt;div role="meter"
      aria-valuenow="90"
      aria-labelledby="cpu_usage_label"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>
        The <code>aria-valuetext</code> property can be set to a string that makes the meter value understandable. For example, a CPU usage meter value might be conveyed as <code>aria-valuetext="90% of CPU is being used"</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Here is another example of a meter that has a range different from the default of 0 for <code>aria-valuemin</code> and 100 for <code>aria-valuemax</code>.</p>

        The <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> properties only need to be set for the <code>progressbar</code> role when the progress bar's minimum is not 0 or the maximum value is not 100.
        The aria-valuenow property needs to be set for a <code>progressbar</code> if its value is known (e.g. not indeterminate).
        If the <code>aria-valuenow</code> property is set, the author needs to make sure it is within the minimum and maximum values.
      </p>
      <p>Following is an example of a progress bar represented by an SVG.</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="loadlabel"&gt;Loading:&lt;/span&gt;

    <h2>Intentionally Hiding Semantics with the <code>presentation</code> Role</h2>
    <p>
      While ARIA is primarily used to express semantics, there are some situations where hiding an
      element’s semantics from assistive technologies is helpful. This is done with the
      <a href="#presentation" class="role-reference">presentation</a>
      role, which declares that an element is being used only for presentation and therefore does
      not have any accessibility semantics. The ARIA 1.1 specification also includes role
      <a href="#none" class="role-reference">none</a>,
      which serves as a synonym for <code>presentation</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider a tabs widget built using an HTML <code>ul</code> element.
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;ul role=&quot;tablist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 1&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 2&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 3&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because the list is declared to be a tablist, the list items are not in a list context. It
      could confuse users if an assistive technology were to render those list items. Applying role
      <code>presentation</code> to the <code>li</code> elements tells browsers to leave those
      elements out of their accessibility tree. Assistive technologies will thus be unaware of the
      list item elements and see the tab elements as immediate children of the tablist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three common uses of role <code>presentation</code> are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hiding a decorative image; it is equivalent to giving the image null alt text. </li>
      <li>Suppressing table semantics of tables used for layout in circumstances where the table semantics do not convey meaningful relationships.</li>
      <li>Eliminating semantics of intervening orphan elements in the structure of a composite
        widget, such as a tablist, menu, or tree as demonstrated in the example above.</li>
    </ol>
    <section id="presentation_role_effects">
      <h3>
        Effects of Role <code>presentation</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        When <code>role=&quot;presentation&quot;</code> is specified on an element, if a
        <a href="#presentation_role_ignored">condition that requires a browser to ignore the <code>presentation</code> role</a>
        does not exist, it has the following three effects.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The element’s implied ARIA role and any ARIA states and properties associated with
          that role are hidden from assistive technologies.</li>
        <li>
          Text contained by the element, i.e., inner text, as well as inner text of all its
          descendant elements remains visible to assistive technologies except, of course, when the
          text is explicitly hidden, e.g., styled with <code>display: none</code> or has <code>aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The roles, states, and properties of each descendant element remain visible to assistive
          technologies unless the descendant requires the context of the presentational
          element. For example:
          <ul>
            <li> If <code>presentation</code> is applied to a <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> element, each child <code>li</code> element inherits the <code>presentation</code> role because ARIA requires the <code>listitem</code> elements to have the parent <code>list</code> element. So, the <code>li</code> elements are not exposed to assistive technologies, but elements contained inside of those <code>li</code> elements, including nested lists, are visible to assistive technologies. </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, if <code>presentation</code> is applied to a <code>table</code> element,
              the descendant <code>caption</code>, <code>thead</code>, <code>tbody</code>, <code>tfoot</code>,
              <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code>, and <code>td</code>
              elements inherit role <code>presentation</code> and are thus not exposed to assistive technologies.
              But, elements inside of the <code>th</code> and <code>td</code> elements, including nested tables,  are exposed to assistive technologies.
            </li>

    <h2>Roles That Automatically Hide Semantics by Making Their Descendants Presentational</h2>
    <p>
      There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform
      accessibility API, can only contain text. For example, accessibility APIs do not have a way of
      representing semantic elements contained in a button. To deal with this limitation, WAI-ARIA
      requires browsers to automatically apply role <code>presentation</code> to all descendant
      elements of any element with a role that cannot support semantic children.
    </p>
    <p>The roles that require all children to be presentational are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>button</li>
      <li>checkbox</li>
      <li>img</li>
      <li>meter</li>
      <li>menuitemcheckbox</li>
      <li>menuitemradio</li>
      <li>option</li>
      <li>progressbar</li>
      <li>radio</li>
      <li>scrollbar</li>
      <li>separator</li>
      <li>slider</li>
      <li>switch</li>
      <li>tab</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For instance, consider the following tab element, which contains a heading.</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because WAI-ARIA requires descendants of tab to be presentational,
      the following code is equivalent.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      And, from the perspective of anyone using a technology that relies on an accessibility API, such as a screen reader,
      the heading does not exist since the previous code is equivalent to the following.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>

  <section id="structural_roles">
    <h2>Structural Roles</h2>
    <p>
      ARIA provides a set of roles that convey the accessibility semantics of structures on a page.
      These roles express the meaning that is conveyed by the layout and appearance of elements that organize and structure content, such as headings, lists, and tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      some host languages, such as HTML, include elements that express the same semantics as an ARIA role.
      For instance, the HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is mapped to accessibility APIs in exactly the same way as <code>&lt;div role="paragraph"&gt;</code>.
      The ARIA and HTML specifications refer to this mapping of HTML elements to ARIA attributes as implied semantics, i.e., the implied ARIA role of the HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is <code>paragraph</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When developing HTML, it is important to use native HTML elements where ever possible.
      Do not use an ARIA role or property if it is possible to use an HTML element that has equivalent semantics.
      Circumstances where it is appropriate to use ARIA attributes instead of equivalent HTML are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>When the HTML element cannot be styled in a way that meets visual design requirements.</li>
      <li>When testing reveals that browsers or assistive technologies provide better support for the ARIA equivalent.</li>
      <li>When remediating or retrofitting legacy content and altering the underlying DOM to use the HTML would be cost prohibitive.</li>
      <li>When building a web component to compose a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#custom-elements">custom element</a> and the element being extended  does not convey the appropriate or sufficient accessibility semantics.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      APG 1.1 supported ARIA 1.1, and this version, APG 1.2, includes changes to support version 1.2 of the ARIA specification.
      It also includes nearly 200 significant updates to improve the quality and breadth of content.
      A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Change-Log-for-November-2021-APG-1.2-Note-Release-1">detailed log of all changes</a> is available on the wiki of the w3c/aria-practices GitHub repository.
      Highlights of major changes to support ARIA 1.2 as well as some of the improvements include the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added section to provide guidance related to 38 document structure roles, 18 of which are new in ARIA 1.2.</li>
      <li>Revised guidance for roles where naming requirements changed in ARIA 1.2. ARIA 1.2 prohibits names on some roles. ARIA 1.2 removed naming requirements from some other roles.</li>
      <li>Added naming guidance for 18 roles that are new in ARIA 1.2.</li>
      <li>Revised the combobox pattern and 4 combobox examples to reflect the ARIA 1.2 revisions to combobox.</li>
      <li>Added example illustrating changes in ARIA 1.2 that enable creation of custom select-only comboboxes, which are similar to HTML select elements. This replaces the Collapsible Listbox example, which is now deprecated.</li>
      <li>Revised the listbox pattern to specify how to utilize the new ARIA 1.2 support for named groups of options and Added a new listbox example to demonstrate the named option group feature.</li>
      <li>Revised the editor menubar example to illustrate new ARIA 1.2 support for named groups of items in a menu.</li>
      <li>Updated the listbox and tree patterns to reflect current browser processing of aria-selected and provided guidance regarding the use of aria-checked to communicate selection.</li>
      <li>Added section providing guidance about properties used with range widgets, such as aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax.</li>
      <li>Added a design pattern and example implementation of the meter role, which is new in ARIA 1.2</li>
      <li>Added two examples that demonstrate how to create rating inputs, one based on slider and one based on radio group.</li>
      <li>Added two other slider examples: a vertical temperature slider and a media seek slider.</li>
      <li>Added a switch design pattern and three example implementations: one made from a div element, one based on HTML button, and one that uses HTML checkbox input.</li>
      <li>Added a button example that illustrates use of the new ARIA 1.2 IDL interface.</li>
      <li>Added a date picker example that illustrates choosing a date with a combobox.</li>
      <li>Added another example of a disclosure navigation menu that demonstrates how to include top-level links.</li>
      <li>Added example of a sortable table.</li>
      <li>Changed all example pages to include a <q>Jump to</q> menu, a button to  open the example in CodePen, and added a prominently placed warning with guidance about testing before re-using example code.</li>
      <li>Improved support for high contrast settings and added detailed documentation of high contrast support in many examples.</li>
      <li>Improved support for touch-based screen readers in several examples, most notably in sliders.</li>
      <li>Due to change in ARIA 1.2, removed Math role from list of roles that have presentational children.</li>
      <li>Developed a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Code-Guide#apg-coding-standards">comprehensive set of coding standards for HTML, CSS, and Javascript</a> for the APG and updated a significant portion of content to conform with the standards.</li>
      <li>In response to feedback, fixed many documentation errors and functional bugs in examples.</li>
