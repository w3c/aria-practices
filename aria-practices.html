            This document provides readers with an understanding of how to use <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.1</a></cite> [[WAI-ARIA]] to create accessible rich internet applications.
            It describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties.
			This document is directed primarily to Web application developers, but the guidance is also useful for user agent and assistive technology developers.
        </p>

        <p>This document is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd"></section>

    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>This section is <em>informative.</em></p>

        <p>
			The WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide is intended to provide an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA to create an accessible Rich Internet Application.
			It describes recommended WAI-ARIA usage patterns and provides an introduction to the concepts behind them.
		</p>

        <p>
			This guide is one part of a suite of resources that support the WAI-ARIA specification.
			The WAI-ARIA suite fills accessibility gaps identified by the [[WAI-ARIA-ROADMAP]].
		</p>

        <p>
            As explained in <a href="#ariaBackground">Background on WAI-ARIA</a>, languages used to create rich and dynamic web sites, e.g., HTML, Javascript, CSS, and SVG, do not natively include all the features required to make sites usable by people who use assistive technologies (AT) or who rely on keyboard navigation.
			The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications working group (ARIA WG) is addressing these deficiencies through several W3C standards efforts, with a focus on the WAI-ARIA specifications.
			For an introduction to WAI-ARIA, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA) Overview</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
			With the understanding many prefer to learn from examples, the guide begins with a section that demonstrates how to make common widgets accessible with descriptions of expected behaviors supported by working code.
			Where it is helpful to do so, the examples refer to detailed explanations of supporting concepts in subsequent sections.
            The sections that follow the examples first provide background that helps build understanding of how WAI-ARIA works and how it fits into the larger web technology picture.
			Next, the guide covers general steps for building an accessible widget using WAI-ARIA, JavaScript, and CSS, including detailed guidance on how to make rich internet applications keyboard accessible.
			The scope then widens to include the full application, addressing the page layout and structural semantics critical to enabling a usable experience with assistive technologies on pages containing both rich applications and rich documents.
			It includes guidance on dynamic document management, use of WAI-ARIA Form properties, and the creation of WAI-ARIA-enabled alerts and dialogs.

    	<h2>Design Patterns and Widgets</h2>

    	<p>This section demonstrates how to make common rich internet application widgets and patterns accessible by applying WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties and implementing keyboard support.</p>

    	<p class="note">
			Although users of Mac OS X are familiar with using the <kbd>Command</kbd> key instead of the <kbd>Control</kbd> key, the <kbd>Command</kbd> key is typically reserved for desktop applications and OS-level integration.
			Until device and platform independence can be addressed in WAI-ARIA 2.0, the primary <kbd>Control</kbd> modifier key for WAI-ARIA widget interaction is specified as <kbd>Control</kbd> on all platforms, including Mac OS X.
		</p>

		<section id="aria_ex_widget">
			<h3>Generally Applicable Keyboard Recommendations </h3>

			<p>The following keyboard conventions are applicable to many of the patterns described in subsequent sections.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><kbd>Shift + F10</kbd> opens associated context menu</li>
				<li><kbd>Control + C</kbd> Copies to clipboard </li>
				<li><kbd>Control + V</kbd> Pastes from clipboard </li>
				<li><kbd>Control + X</kbd> Copies to clipboard and cuts </li>
				<li><kbd>Control + Z</kbd> undo last action</li>
				<li><kbd>Control + Y</kbd> Redo action</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="note">The following guidance on nested widgets will be moved to another section.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Widgets within Widgets</strong>
				The general navigation model is for a user to tab to a widget, interact with the controls in that widget and then tab to move focus to the next widget in the tab order.
				By extension, when the construct of a widget contains another widget, tab will move focus to the contained widget because it is the next item in the tab order.
				This continues down the layers of widgets until the last widget is reached.
				For example, if there are two widgets A and B on a page where widget A contains within it Widget A1 and Widget A1 contains within it Widget A2, the focus sequence when pressing the tab key would be A, A1, A2, B.

                <h3>Accordion (Sections With Show/Hide Functionality)</h3>
                <p class="note">This section is work in progress. Provide feedback in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/53">issue 53</a>.</p>
            <p>An accordion is a vertically stacked set of elements, such as labels or
                thumbnails, that allow the user to toggle the display of sections of content. Each
                labeling element can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide its associated
                content. Accordions are commonly used to reduce the need to scroll when presenting
                multiple sections of content on a single page.</p>
            <p>Terms for understanding accordions include:</p>
            <dl>
<dt>Accordion Header:</dt>
                    <dd>Label for or thumbnail representing a section of content that also serves as a control for showing, and in some implementations, hiding  the section of content. </dd>
                    <dt>Accordion Panel:</dt>
                    <dd>Section of content associated with an accordion header.</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>In some accordions, there are additional elements that are always visible adjacent to the accordion header. 
                For instance, a menubutton may accompany each accordion header to provide access to actions that apply to that section.
                And, in some cases, a snippet of the hidden content may also be visually persistent. </p>

                            <li>When focus is on the accordion header for a collapsed panel,
                                expands its accordion panel. If the implementation allows only one
                                panel to be expanded and another panel is expanded, collapses that
                                panel.</li>
                            <li>When focus is on the accordion header for an expanded panel,
                                collapses the panel if the implementation supports collapsing. Some
                                implementations require one panel to be expanded at all times and
                                allow only one panel to be expanded; so, they do not support a
                                collapse function.</li>

                        accordion panel or on an accordion header, moves focus to the next accordion
                        header. If focus is in the last accordion header or panel, either does
                        nothing or moves focus to the first accordion header.</li>
                    <li><kbd>Control + Page Up</kbd> (Optional): If focus is inside an
                        accordion panel, moves focus to the header for that panel. If focus is on an
                        accordion header, moves focus to the previous accordion header. If focus is
                        on the first accordion header, either does nothing or moves focus to the
                        last accordion header.</li>

                The button label is the label for the associated accordion panel.</li>
                <li>The accordion header <code>button</code> element has <a href="aria-controls" class="property-reference">aria-controls</a> set to the ID of the element containing the accordion panel content. </li>
                <li>If the accordion panel associated with an accordion header is visible, the header <code>button</code> element has <a href="#aria-expanded" class="state-reference">aria-expanded</a> set to <code>true</code>.
                If the panel is not visible, <a href="#aria-expanded" class="state-reference">aria-expanded</a> is set to <code>false</code>. </li>
                <li>If the accordion panel associated with an accordion header is visible, and if the accordion does not permit the panel to be collapsed,
                the header <code>button</code> element has <a href="#aria-disabled" class="state-reference">aria-disabled</a> set to <code>true</code>. </li>
                    <li>Each accordion header <code>button</code> is wrapped in an element with role <a href="#heading" class="role-reference">heading</a> that has a value set for <a href="#aria-level" class="property-reference">aria-level</a> that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.
                    If the native host language has an element with an implicit <code>heading</code> and <code>aria-level</code>, such as an HTML heading tag, a native host language element may be used. 
                    The <code>button</code> element is the only element inside the <code>heading</code> element. 
                    That is, if there are other visually persistent elements, they are not included inside the <code>heading</code> element. </li>

    <section class="widget" id="alert">
      <h3>Alert</h3>

      <p>
        An <a class="role-reference" href="#alert">alert</a> is an element that displays a brief, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task.
        Dynamically rendered alerts are automatically announced by most screen readers, and in some operating systems, they may trigger an alert sound.
        It is important to note that, at this time, screen readers do not inform users of alerts that are present on the page before page load completes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because an alert is intended to provide important and potentially time-sensitive information without interfering with the user's ability to continue working, authors should ensure alerts do not affect the keyboard focus.
        If there is a need to interrupt work flow, consider using an <a href="#alertdialog">alert dialog</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In most circumstances, authors should avoid making alerts disappear automatically.
        An alert that disappears too quickly can lead to failure to meet <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-no-exceptions.html">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.3</a>.
        In addition, authors should be careful to avoid overuse of alerts.
        Frequent interruptions inhibit usability for people with visual and cognitive disabilities, leading to failures to meet <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-postponed.html">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.4</a>.

      <h3>Alert Dialog or Message Dialog</h3>
      <p class="note">This section is partially revised. Planned changes are being discussed in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/54">issue 54</a>.</p>

      <p>
        A dialog with the primary purpose of communicating a message and acquiring a user response to that message.
        Examples include action confirmation prompts, warning messages, or help for an invalid form entry.
        The dialog should be modal.
        Keyboard focus is set on an element in the dialog.
        The element that has initial focus will depend on the nature of the information conveyed in the dialog.
        Simple message dialogs, as described below, have their initial focus set to the confirmation button (e.g., the OK button).
        Detail message dialogs have their initial focus set on the element containing the message.
      </p>

      <p>A detail message dialog conveys a message that has any one of the following attributes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Is more than one sentence in length;</li>
        <li>Contains information where punctuation is an essential part of the message, such as syntax of a required date format;</li>
        <li>Contains detail information the user may need to re-use, e.g., a phone number, e-mail address, error number, etc.;</li>
        <li>Contains an interactive element, such as a link to a help resource.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the dialog is not a detail message dialog, one can consider it a simple message dialog.</p>

        <p><a href="#dialog_modal">See Dialog (Modal)</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content authors make alert dialogs modal by ensuring that, while the alertdialog is shown, keyboard and mouse interactions only operate within the dialog.</li>
          <li>The message area of a detail message dialog is focusable and has a <a class="role-reference" href="#document">document</a> role so screen reader users will have complete access to the message content, e.g., the screen reader can read it by character, word, or line.</li>
          <li>When the message area of a dialog is focusable and has focus, a visual focus indicator is required, and it is recommended that the indicator encompass the complete message.</li>

	    A breadcrumb consists of a list of links to the parent pages of the current page in hierarchical order.
	    These help users find their place within a website or web application.
	    Breadcrumbs are often placed horizontally before a page's main content.

      <h3>Button</h3>

      <p>
        A <a class="role-reference" href="#button">button</a> is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.
        A common convention for informing users that a button launches a dialog is to append &quot;&#8230;&quot; (ellipsis) to the button label, e.g., &quot;Save as&#8230;&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the ordinary button widget, WAI-ARIA supports 2 other types of buttons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Toggle button: A two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed).
          To tell assistive technologies that a button is a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute <a href="#aria-pressed" class="state-reference">aria-pressed</a>.
          For example, a button labeled mute in an audio player could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true.
          <strong>Important:</strong> the label on a toggle button should never change when the state changes.
          In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label should not change to &quot;Unmute"&quot; or &quot;Muted.&quot;
        </li>
        <li>Menu button: as described in the <a href="#menubutton">menu button pattern</a>, a button will be revealed to assistive technologies as a menu button if it has the property <a href="#aria-haspopup" class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</a> set true.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        The types of actions performed by buttons are distinctly different from the function of a link (see <a href="#link">link pattern</a>).
        It is important that the role of a widget matches the function it provides.
        Ideally, the role of the element also matches its visual appearance.
        But, occasionally an element may be visually styled as an icon or link but perform the action of a button.
        In these cases, the element should be given a button role.
        Designers should work to avoid conflicts between visual appearance and WAI-ARIA semantics.
      </p>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h4>Keyboard Interaction</h4>
        <p>
          With focus on the button, pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key activates the button.
          Focus should behave appropriately for the type of action being performed.
          For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If activating the button opens a dialog, the focus moves inside the dialog.
            (see <a href="#dialog_nonmodal">dialog pattern</a>)
          </li>
          <li>
            If activating the button closes a dialog, typically focus should return to the button that opened the dialog unless the function performed in the dialog context logically leads to a different element.
            For example, activating a cancel button in a dialog should always return focus to the button that opened the dialog.
            However, if the dialog is confirming a delete action that deletes the page from which it was opened, the focus must logically move to a new context.
          </li>
          <li>If activating the button does not dismiss the current context, then focus should typically remain on the button after activation, e.g., an Apply or Recalculate button.</li>
          <li>If the button action indicates a context change, such as move to next step in a wizard or add another search criteria, then it may be appropriate to move focus to the starting point for that action.</li>
          <li>
            If the button is activated with a shortcut key, the focus should usually remain in the context from which the shortcut key was activated.
            For example, if <kbd>Alt + U</kbd> were assigned to an &quot;Up&quot; button that moves the currently focused item in a list one position higher in the list, pressing <kbd>Alt + U</kbd> when the focus is in the list should not move the focus from the list.

            By default, the accessible name is computed from any text content inside the button element.

      <h3>Checkbox</h3>

      <p>WAI-ARIA supports two types of <a href="#checkbox" class="role-reference">checkbox</a> widgets:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dual-state: The most common type of checkbox, it allows the user to toggle between two choices -- checked and not checked.</li>
        <li>Tri-state: This type of checkbox supports an additional third state known as partially checked.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        One common use of a tri-state checkbox can be found in software installers where a single tri-state checkbox is used to represent and control the state of an entire group of install options.
        And, each option in the group can be individually turned on or off with a dual state checkbox.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If all options in the group are checked, the overall state is represented by the tri-state checkbox displaying as checked.</li>
        <li>If some of the options in the group are checked, the overall state is represented with the tri-state checkbox displaying as partially checked.</li>
        <li>If none of the options in the group are checked, the overall state of the group is represented with the tri-state checkbox displaying as not checked.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The user can use the tri-state checkbox to change all options in the group with a single action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Checking the overall checkbox checks all options in the group.</li>
        <li>Unchecking the overall checkbox will uncheck all options in the group.</li>
        <li>
          And, In some implementations, the system may remember which options were checked the last time the overall status was partially checked.
          If this feature is provided, activating the overall checkbox a third time recreates that partially checked state where only some options in the group are checked.

            <h3>Grids : Interactive Tabular Data and Layout Containers</h3>
            <p>
                A <a href="#grid" class="role-reference">grid</a> widget is a container that enables users to navigate the information or interactive elements it contains using directional navigation keys, such as arrow keys, <kbd>Home</kbd> , and <kbd>End</kbd>.
                As a generic container widget that offers flexible keyboard navigation, it can serve a wide variety of needs. 
                It can be used for purposes as simple as grouping a
                collection of checkboxes or navigation links or as complex as creating a
                full-featured spreadsheet application. While ARIA properties and assistive
                technologies use row and column nomenclature when describing and presenting the
                logical structure of elements with the <code>grid</code> role, using the <code>grid</code>
                role on an element does not necessarily imply that its visual presentation is tabular.
            </p>
            <p>When presenting content that is tabular, consider the following factors when choosing between implementing this <code>grid</code> patern or the <a href="#table">table</a> pattern.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>A <code>grid</code> is a composite widget so it:
                <ul>
                <li>Always contains multiple focusable elements. </li>
                <li>Has only one focusable element in the page tab sequence.</li>
                <li>Requires the author to provide code that <a href="#kbd_general_within">manages focus movement inside it</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>All focusable elements contained in a table are included in the page tab sequence. </li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Uses of the <code>grid</code> pattern broadly fall into two categories: presenting tabular information (data grids) and grouping other widgets (layout grids).
                Even though both data grids and layout grids employ the same ARIA roles, states, and properties, differences in their content and purpose surface factors that are important to consider in keyboard interaction design.
                To address these factors, the following two sections describe separate keyboard interaction patterns for data and layout grids.
            </p>
            <section id="dataGrid" class="notoc">
                <h4>Data Grids For Presenting Tabular Information</h4>
                <p>
                    A
                    <code>grid</code>
                    can be used to present tabular information that has column titles, row titles,
                    or both. The
                    <code>grid</code>
                    pattern is particularly useful if the tabular information is editable or
                    interactive. For example, when data elements are links to more information,
                    rather than presenting them in a static table and including the links in the tab
                    sequence, implementing the
                    <code>grid</code>
                    pattern provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation of the
                    grid contents as well as a shorter tab sequence for the page. A
                    <code>grid</code>
                    may also offer functions, such as cell content editing, selection, cut, copy,
                    and paste.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a grid that presents tabular data, every cell contains a focusable element or
                    is itself focusable, regardless of whether the cell content is editable or
                    interactive. There is one exception: if column or row header cells do not
                    provide functions, such as sort or filter, they do not need to be focusable. One
                    reason this is important is that screen readers need to be in their application
                    reading mode, rather than their document reading mode, while the user is
                    interacting with the grid. While in application reading mode, a screen reader
                    user can only discover focusable elements and content that labels focusable
                    elements. So, a screen reader user may unknowningly overlook elements contained
                    in a grid that are either not focusable or not used to label a column or row. A
                    more detailed description of this topic with examples is available in the
                    section describing <a href="#ScreenReaderModes">screen reader document and
                        application reading modes</a>.

                <h4>Layout Grids for Grouping Widgets</h4>
                <p>
                The <code>grid</code> pattern  can be used to group a set of interactive elements, such as links, buttons,  or checkboxes.
                Since only one element in the entire grid is included in the tab sequence, grouping with a grid can dramatically reduce the number of tab stops on a page.
                This is especially valuable if scrolling through a list of elements dynamically loads more of those elements from a large data set, such as in a continuous list of suggested products on a shopping site.
                If elements in a list like this were in the tab sequence, keyboard users are effectively trapped in the list.
                If any elements in the group also have associated elements that appear on hover, the <code>grid</code> pattern is also useful for providing keyboard access to those contextual elements of the user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                Unlike grids used to present data, A <code>grid</code> used for layout does not necessarily have header cells for labeling rows or columns and might contain only a single row or a single column.
                Even if it has multiple rows and columns, it may present a single, logically homogenous set of elements.
                For example, a list of recipients for a message may be a grid where each cell contains a link that represents a recipient. 
                The grid may initially have a single row but then wrap into multiple rows as recipients are added.
                In such circumstances, grid navigation keys may also wrap so the user can read the list from beginning to end by pressing either <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>.
                While This type of focus movement wrapping can be very helpful in a layout grid, it would be disorienting if used in a data grid, especially for users of assistive technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                Because arrow keys are used to move focus inside of a <code>grid</code>, a <code>grid</code> is both easier to build and use if the components it contains do not require the arrow keys to operate.
                If a cell contains an element like a <a href="#Listbox">listbox</a>, then an extra key command to focus and activate the listbox is needed as well as a command for restoring the grid navigation functionality.
                Aproaches to supporting this need are described in the section on 
                <a href="#gridNav_inside">Editing and Navigating Inside a Cell</a>.

                    <h5>Whether to Focus on a Cell Or an Element Inside IT</h5>
                    <p>
                        For assistive technology users, the quality of experience when navigating a grid heavily depends on both what a cell contains and on where keyboard focus is set.
                        For example, if a cell contains a button and a grid navigation key places focus on the cell instead of the button, screen readers announce the button label but do not tell users a button is present.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are two optimal cell design and focus behavior combinations: </p>
                <ol>
                <li>
                A cell contains one widget whose operation does not require arrow keys and grid navigation keys set focus on that widget.
                    Examples of such widgets include link, button, menubutton, toggle button, radio button (not radio group), switch, and checkbox. 
                    </li>
                    <li>A cell contains text or a single graphic and grid navigation keys set focus on the cell.</li> 
                </ol>
                <p>
                While any combination of widgets, text, and graphics may be included in a single cell, grids that do not follow one of these two cell design and focus movement patterns add complexity for authors or users or both.
                The reference implementations included in the example section below demonstrate some strategies for making other cell designs as accessible as possible, but the most widely accessible experiences are likely to come by applying the above two patterns.

                    <p>
                        While navigation keys, such as arrow keys, are moving focus from cell to cell, they are not available to perform actions like operate a combobox or move an editing caret inside of a cell.
                The user may need keys that are used for grid navigation to operate elements inside a cell if a cell contains:
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li>Editable content.</li>
                <li>Multiple widgets.</li>
                <li>A widget that utilizes arrow keys in its interaction model, such as a radio group or slider.</li>
                </ol>
        <p>Following are common keyboard conventions for disabling and restoring grid navigation functions. </p>
        <ul>
        <li><kbd>Enter</kbd>: Disables grid navigation and:
        <ul>
        <li>If the cell contains editable content, places focus in an input field, such as a <a href="#textbox" class="role-reference">textbox</a>. If the input is a single-line text field, a subsequent press of <kbd>Enter</kbd> may either restore grid navigation functions or move focus to an input field in a neighboring cell.</li> 
        <li>If the cell contains one or more widgets, places focus on the first widget. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><kbd>F2</kbd>:
        <ul>
        <li>If the cell contains editable content, places focus in an input field, such as a <a href="#textbox" class="role-reference">textbox</a>. A subsequent press of <kbd>F2</kbd> restores grid navigation functions. </li>
        <li>If the cell contains one or more widgets, places focus on the first widget. A subsequent press of <kbd>F2</kbd> restores grid navigation functions. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Alphanumeric keys: If the cell contains editable content, places focus in an input field, such as a <a href="#textbox" class="role-reference">textbox</a>. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When grid navigation is disabled, conventional changes to navigation behaviors include: </p>
        <ul>
        <li><kbd>Escape</kbd>: restores grid navigation. If content was being edited, it may also undo edits. </li>
        <li><kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>: If the cell contains multiple widgets, moves focus to the next widget inside the cell, optionally wrapping to the first widget if focus is on the last widget. Otherwise, passes the key event to the focused widget. </li>
        <li><kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>: If the cell contains multiple widgets, moves focus to the previous widget inside the cell, optionally wrapping to the first widget if focus is on the last widget. Otherwise, passes the key event to the focused widget. </li>
          <li><kbd>Tab</kbd>: moves focus to the next widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself. </li>
          <li><kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>: moves focus to the previous widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself. </li>

      <h3>Listbox</h3>

      <p>
        A <a href="#listbox" class="role-reference">listbox</a> widget allows a user to select one or more items from a list of options.
        A listbox that allows a single option to be chosen is a single-select listbox; one that allows multiple options to be selected is a multi-select listbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contents of <code>option</code> elements in a <code>listbox</code> are reduced by browsers to static text strings that become the accessible names of the options.
        So, <code>options</code> in a <code>listbox</code> should not contain interactive elements, such as links, buttons, or checkboxes.
        To create a list of interactive elements, see the <a href="#grid">grid</a> pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
      Authors should avoid creating options with very long names.
       Each option name is spoken by a screen reader as a single unit of speech when the user navigates the list.
       When a large amount information is spoken as the result of a single key press, it can be difficult to understand.
      If the speaking of an option is interrupted, the user will typically have to re-read the entire option.
        And, if the user does not understand what is spoken, re-reading of a listbox option name by character, word, or phrase may be a difficult operation for some screen reader users because the screen reader is in an interactive mode, rather than a reading mode, when operating a widget like a listbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors should also avoid creating sets of options where each option name starts with the same word or phrase.
        Otherwise, scrolling through the list to find a specific option becomes inordinately time consuming for a screen reader user who must listen to that word or phrase repeated before hearing what is unique about each option.
        For example, if a listbox for choosing a city were to contain options where each city name were preceded by a country name, and if many cities were listed for each country, a screen reader user would have to listen to the country name before hearing each city name.
        In such a scenario, it would be better to have 2 list boxes, one for country and one for city.

    <h3>Menu or Menu bar</h3>
      <p>
        A <a href="#menu" class="role-reference">menu</a> is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or functions.
        A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a <a href="#menubutton">menu button</a>, choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as <kbd>Shift + F10</kbd> in Windows, that opens a context specific menu.
        When a user activates a choice in a menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu.
      </p>

      <p>
        A menu that is visually persistent is a <a href="#menubar" class="role-reference">menubar</a>.
        A menubar is typically horizontal and is often used to create a menu bar similar to those found near the top of the window in many desktop applications, offering the user quick access to a consistent set of commands.
      </p>

      <p>A common convention for indicating that a menu item launches a dialog box is to append &quot;&#8230;&quot; (ellipsis) to the menu item label, e.g., &quot;Save as &#8230;&quot;.</p>

              <li>The menu container has <code>tabindex</code> set to <code>-1</code> or <code>0</code> and <a href="#aria-activedescendant" class="property-reference">aria-activedescendant</a> set to the ID of the focused item. </li>
              <li>Each item in the menu has <code>tabindex</code> set to <code>-1</code>, except in a menubar, where the first item has <code>tabindex</code> set to <code>0</code>. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If activating a <a href="#menuitem" class="role-reference">menuitem</a> opens a submenu, the menuitem has <a href="#aria-haspopup" class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</a> set to <code>true</code>. </li>
          <li>When a <a href="#menuitemcheckbox" class="role-reference">menuitemcheckbox</a> or <a href="#menuitemradio" class="role-reference">menuitemradio</a> is checked, <a href="#aria-checked" class="property-reference">aria-checked</a> is set to <code>true</code>. </li>
          <li>When a menu item is disabled, <a href="#aria-disabled" class="state-reference">aria-disabled</a> is set to <code>true</code>.</li>
          <li>Items in a menu may be divided into groups by placing an element with a role of <a href="#separator" class="role-reference">separator</a> between groups. For example, this technique should be used when a menu contains a set of <a href="#menuitemradio" class="role-reference">menuitemradio</a> items. </li>
          <li>All <a href="#separator" class="role-reference">separators</a> should have <a href="#aria-orientation" class="property-reference">aria-orientation</a> consistent with the separator's orientation. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">If <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> is set on the menu container to include elements that are not DOM children of the container, those elements will appear in the reading order in the sequence they are referenced and after any items that are DOM children. Scripts that manage focus need to ensure the visual focus order matches this assistive technology reading order. </p>

      <p>A widget that allows users to choose a value from a set, or range, of discrete values. For example, select a number from 1 to 59 for the minute of an hour when setting an alarm.</p>

      <p>A spin button provides ways to easily increment and decrement the value. If the range is large, it may support changing the value by both a single step and by multiple steps at once. For instance, in the alarm example, the user may be able to move by 1 minute with the arrow keys and by 10 minutes with PageUp and PageDown.</p>

        <p>
        [Place holder for a to-be-written section about data tables] 
        While writing the grid pattern, the topic of data tables came up because the grid pattern has text clarifying when to use grid verses when to use table.
        There was a suggestion to cover tables at the same time in the grid section.
        That made the grid pattern section feel overwhelming so adding a placeholder for a potential table section here.
        The grid pattern links to this section.

      <h3>Tabs</h3>
      <p>
        Tabs are a set of layered sections of content, known as tab panels, that display one panel of content at a time.
        Each tab panel has an associated tab element, that when activated, displays the panel.
        The list of tab elements is arranged along one edge of the currently displayed panel, most commonly the top edge.
      </p>
      <p>Terms used to describe this design pattern include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Tabs or Tabbed Interface</dt>
        <dd>A set of tab elements and their associated tab panels.</dd>
        <dt>Tab List</dt>
        <dd>A set of tab elements contained in a <a href="#tablist" class="role-reference">tablist</a> element.</dd>
        <dt><a href="#tab" class="role-reference">tab</a></dt>
        <dd>An element in the tab list that serves as a label for one of the tab panels and can be activated to display that panel. </dd>
        <dt><a href="#tabpanel" class="role-reference">tabpanel</a></dt>
        <dd>The element that contains the content associated with a tab.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
      When a tabbed interface is initialized, one tab panel is displayed and its associated tab is styled to indicate that it is active.
        When the user activates one of the other tab elements, the previously displayed tab panel is hidden, the tab panel associated with the activated tab becomes visible, and the tab is considered "active".

                It is recommended that tabs activate automatically when they receive focus as long as their associated tab panels are displayed without noticeable latency.
                This typically requires tab panel content to be preloaded.
                Otherwise, automatic activation slows focus movement, which significantly hampers users' ability to navigate efficiently across the tab list.

      <h3>Toolbar</h3>

      <p>A <a class="role-reference" href="#toolbar">toolbar</a> is a container for grouping a set of controls, such as buttons, menubuttons, or checkboxes.</p>
      <p>
        When a set of controls is visually presented as a group, the <code>toolbar</code> role can be used to communicate the presence and purpose of the grouping to screen reader users.
        Grouping controls into toolbars can also be an effective way of reducing the number of tab stops in the keyboard interface.
      </p>
      <p>When designing and implementing toolbars, it is strongly recommended that authors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Implement focus management so there is one stop in the keyboard tab sequence for the toolbar and arrow keys move focus among the contained controls.</li>
        <li>Avoid including controls that require arrow keys to operate, such as textbox or radio group. If unavoidable, include only one such control and make it the last element .</li>
        <li>Use toolbar as a grouping element only if the group contains 3 or more controls.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>

            When focus moves into the toolbar, the first enabled control receives focus.
            Optionally, if the toolbar has previously contained focus, the control that last had focus may receive focus.
          </li>
          <li>For a horizontal toolbar (the default):
            <ul>
              <li><kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus to the previous control.  Optionally, focus movement may wrap from the first element to the last element. </li>

          </li>
          <li>Typically, disabled elements are not focusable when navigating with a keyboard. However, in circumstances where discoverability of a function is crucial, authors may choose to make disabled controls focusable so screen reader users are more likely to be aware of their presence. </li>
          <li>In applications where quick access to a toolbar is important, such as accessing an editor's toolbar from its text area, it is recommended that authors provide a documented shortcut key for moving focus from the relevant context to its corresponding toolbar. </li>

      <p>
        Popup that displays a description for an element when a user hovers over or focuses on that element.
        It should popup automatically when the user gives input focus to the widget or element with which it is associated.
        The tooltip widget can be dismissed by pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key or by other methods noted below.

      <h3>Tree View</h3>
      <p>
        A tree view is a component to navigate hierarchical lists.
        It is made up of one or more top level nodes.
        A node may have children or it may be an end node.
        Nodes with children can be expanded or collapsed - when expanded its child nodes are visible.
        When collapsed the children are not visible.
        There is generally some sort of visual indication whether a node has children and can be expanded.
        Any number of nodes can be expanded at a time and child nodes may contain children.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a Tree View is a File Navigator where a tree view is used to navigate the directories and files on a file system.
        The directory nodes can be expanded and collapsed to reveal its contained subdirectories and files.
        Terms for understanding tree views include:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>node</dt>
        <dd>An item in a tree. </dd>
        <dt>parent node</dt>
        <dd>Node with children. It can be opened / expanded or closed / collapsed </dd>
        <dt>open node</dt>
        <dd>Expanded node with children; first-level children are visible. </dd>
        <dt>closed node</dt>
        <dd>Closed node with children; the children are not visible. </dd>
        <dt>end node</dt>
        <dd>Node with no children </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>Nodes can be focused and/or selected. There must be visual distinction between focused and selected nodes. </p>

        <h2>Landmark Roles Design Patterns</h2>

        <p>
            Landmarks provide a powerful way to identify the organization and structure of a web page.
            The structural information conveyed visually to users should be represented programmatically in the markup using landmark roles.
            The use of landmark roles supports keyboard navigation to the structure of a web page for screen reader users, and can be used as targets for author supplied &quot;skip links&quot; and browser extensions for enhanced keyboard navigation.
        </p>

        <p>This section is intended to assist designers, developers and quality assurance staff in defining and understanding the importance of logical, usable, and accessible layout for assistive technologies using HTML5 sectioning elements and ARIA landmark roles.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>HTML5 Sectioning Elements</h3>

            <p>
                It is important to understand that many HTML5 sectioning elements by default define ARIA landmarks.
                If HTML5 sectioning elements are used without understanding the associated landmark structure, assistive technology users will most likely be confused and less efficient in accessing content and interacting with web pages.

            </p>

                <caption>Default landmark roles for HTML5 sectioning elements</caption>

            <h3>General Principles of Landmark Design</h3>

            <p>Due to the complexity of todays web content, if using landmarks, <strong>all content</strong> should reside in a semantically meaningful landmark in order that content is not missed by the user.</p>

            <p><strong>Step 1: Identify the logical structure</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Break the page into perceivable areas of content which designers typically indicate visually using alignment and spacing.</li>

                <li>Areas can be further defined into logical sub-areas as needed.</li>

                <li>An example of a sub-area is a portlet in a portal application.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 2: Assign landmark roles to each area</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Assign landmark roles based on the type of content in the area.</li>

                <li><code>banner</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>complementary</code> and <code>contentinfo</code> landmarks should be top level landmarks.</li>

                <li>Landmark roles can be nested to identify parent/child relationships of the information being presented.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Step 3: Label areas</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>If a specific landmark role is used more than once on a web page, it should have a unique label.</li>

                <li>If a landmark is only used once on the page it may not require a label. See Landmark Roles section below. </li>

                <li>If an area begins with a heading element (e.g. <code>h1-h6</code>) it can be used as the label for the area using the
                <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute.</li>

                <li>If an area requires a label and does not have a heading element, provide a label using the <code>aria-label</code> attribute.</li>

                <li>
                    Do not use the landmark role as part of the label.
                    For example, a navigation landmark with a label &quot;Site Navigation&quot; will be announced by a screen reader as &quot;Site Navigation Navigation&quot;.
                    The label should simply be &quot;Site&quot;.
                </li>
            </ul>

                    A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#banner"><code>banner</code></a> landmark identifies site-oriented content at the beginning of each page within a website.
                    Site-oriented content typically includes things such as the logo or identity of the site sponsor, and site-specific search tool.
                    A banner usually appears at the top of the page and typically spans the full width.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each page may have one <code>banner</code> landmark.</li>

                    <li>The <code>banner</code> landmark should be a top-level landmark.</li>

                    <li>When a page contains nested <code>document</code> and/or <code>application</code> roles (e.g. typically through the use of <code>iframe</code> and <code>frame</code> elements), each <code>document</code> or <code>application</code> role may have one <code>banner</code> landmark.</li>

                    <li>If a page includes more than one <code>banner</code> landmark, each should have a unique label (see Step 3 above).</li>

        <h2>Developing a Keyboard Interface</h2>
        <p>Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for
            graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with ARIA; authors
            have to provide the keyboard support in their code. This section describes the
            principles and methods for making the functionality of a web page that includes ARIA
            widgets, such as menus and grids, as well as interactive components, such as toolbars
            and dialogs, operable with a keyboard. Along with the basics of focus management, this
            section offers guidance toward the objective of providing experiences to people who rely
            on a keyboard that are as efficient and enjoyable as the experiences available to
            others. It covers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Understanding fundamental principles of focus movement conventions used in ARIA
                design patterns.</li>
            <li>Maintaining visible focus, predictable focus movement, and distinguishing
                between keyboard focus and the selected state.</li>
            <li>Managing movement of keyboard focus between components, e.g., how the focus
                moves when the <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> keys are pressed.
            </li>
            <li>Managing movement of keyboard focus inside components that contain multiple
                focusable elements, e.g., two different methods for programatically exposing focus
                inside widgets like radio groups, menus, listboxes, trees, and grids.</li>
            <li>Managing focus for modal and non-modal dialogs.</li>
            <li>Determining when to make disabled interactive elements focusable.</li>
            <li>Assigning and revealing keyboard shortcuts, including guidance on how to avoid
                problematic conflicts with keyboard commands of assistive technologies, browsers,
                and operating systems.</li>
            <li>Addressing macro navigation concerns, i.e., methods for enabling efficient
                keyboard access to different sections of a page or site.</li>

            <h3>Fundamental Keyboard Navigation Conventions</h3>
            <p>ARIA roles, states, and properties model accessibility behaviors and features
                shared among GUI components of popular desktop GUIs, including Microsoft Windows,
                Mac OS X, and GNOME. Similarly, ARIA design patterns borrow user expectations and
                keyboard conventions from those platforms, consistently incorporating common
                conventions with the aim of facilitating easy learning and efficient operation of
                keyboard interfaces across the web.</p>
            <p>
                For a web page to be accessible, all interactive elements must be operable via the
                keyboard. In addition, consistent application of the common GUI keyboard interface
                conventions described in the <a href="#aria_ex">ARIA design patterns</a> is
                important, especially for assistive technology users. Consider, for example, a
                screen reader user operating a tree. Just as familiar visual styling helps users
                discover how to expand a tree branch with a mouse, ARIA attributes give the tree the
                sound and feel of a tree in a desktop application. So, screen reader users will
                commonly expect that pressing the right arrow key will expand a collapsed node.
                Because the screen reader knows the element is a tree, it also has the ability to
                instruct a novice user how to operate it. Similarly, voice recognition software can
                implement commands for expanding and collapsing branches because it recognizes the
                element as a tree and can execute appropriate keyboard commands. All this is only
                possible if the tree implements the GUI keyboard conventions as described in the <a
                    href="#TreeView">ARIA tree pattern</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A primary keyboard navigation convention common across all platforms is that the
                <kbdd>tab</kbdd>
                and
                <kbd>shift+tab</kbd>
                keys move focus from one UI component to another while other keys, primarily the
                arrow keys, move focus inside of components that include multiple focusable
                elements. The path that the focus follows when pressing the
                <kbd>tab</kbd>
                key is known as the tab sequence or tab ring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common examples of UI components that contain multiple focusable elements are radio
                groups, tablists, menus, and grids. A radio group, for example, contains multiple
                radio buttons, each of which is focusable. However, only one of the radio buttons is
                included in the tab sequence. After pressing the
                <kbd>Tab</kbd>
                key moves focus to a radio button in the group, pressing arrow keys moves focus
                among the radio buttons in the group, and pressing the
                <kbd>Tab</kbd>
                key moves focus out of the radio group to the next element in the tab sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ARIA specification refers to a discrete UI component that contains multiple
                focusable elements as a <a href="#composite" class="role-reference">composite</a>
                widget. The process of controlling focus movement inside a composite is called
                managing focus. Following are some ARIA design patterns with example implementations
                that demonstrate focus management:
            </p>

            <h3>Discernable and Predictable Keyboard Focus</h3>
            <p>When operating with a keyboard, two essentials of a good experience are the
                abilities to easily discern the location of the keyboard focus and to discover where
                focus landed after a navigation key has been pressed. The following factors affect
                to what extent a web page affords users these capabilities.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Visibility of the focus indicator: Users need to be able to easily
                    distinguish the keyboard focus indicator from other features of the visual
                    design. Just as a mouse user may move the mouse to help find the mouse pointer,
                    a keyboard user may press a navigation key to watch for movement. If visual
                    changes in response to focus movement are subtle, many users will lose track of
                    focus and be unable to operate. Authors are advised to rely on the default focus
                    indicators provided by browsers. If overriding the default, consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>something about ... Colors and gradients can disappear in high
                            contrast modes.</li>
                        <li>Users need to be able to easily distinguish between focus and
                            selection as described in <a href="#kbd_focus_vs_selection"></a>,
                            especially when a component that contains selected elements does not
                            contain the focus.
                        </li>
                        <li>... other considerations to be added ...</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Persistence of focus: It is essential that there is always a component
                    within the user interface that is active (document.activeElement is not null or
                    is not the body element) and that the active element has a visual focus
                    indicator. Authors need to manage events that effect the currently active
                    element so focus remains visible and moves logically. For example, if the user
                    closes a dialog or performs a destructive operation like deleting an item from a
                    list, the active element may be hidden or removed from the DOM. If such events
                    are not managed to set focus on the button that triggered the dialog or on the
                    list item following the deleted item, browsers move focus to the body element,
                    affectively causing a loss of focus within the user interface.</li>
                <li>Predictability of movement: Usability of a keyboard interface is heavily
                    influenced by how readily users can guess where focus will land after a
                    navigation key is pressed. Some possible approaches to optimizing predictability
                    include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Move focus in a pattern that matches the reading order of the
                            page's language. In left to right languages, for example, create a tab
                            sequence that moves focus left to right and then top to bottom.</li>
                        <li>Incorporate all elements of a section of the page in the tab
                            sequence before moving focus to another section. For instance, in a page
                            with multiple columns that has content in a left side bar, center
                            region, and right side bar, build a tab sequence that covers all
                            elements in the left sidebar before focus moves to the first focusable
                            element in the center column.</li>
                        <li>When the distance between two consecutive elements in the tab
                            sequence is significant, avoid movement that would be perceived as
                            backward. For example, on a page with a left to right language, a jump
                            from the last element in the bottom right of the main content to the top
                            element in a left-hand sidebar is likely to be less predictable and more
                            difficult to follow, especially for users with a narrow field of view.</li>
                        <li>Follow consistent patterns across a site. The keyboard experience
                            is more predictable when similar pages have similar focus movement
                            patterns.</li>
                        <li>Do not set initial focus when the page loads except in cases where:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The page offers a single, primary function that nearly all
                                    users employ immediately after page load.</li>
                                <li>Any given user is likely to use the page often.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </ol>

        <section id="kbd_focus_vs_selection">
            <h3>Focus VS Selection and the Perception of Dual Focus</h3>
            <p>Occasionally, it may appear as if two elements on the page have focus at the same
                time. For example, in a multi-select list box, when an option is selected it may be
                greyed. Yet, the focus indicator can still be moved to other options, which may also
                be selected. Similarly, when a user activates a tab in a tablist, the selected state
                is set on the tab and its visual appearance changes. However, the user can still
                navigate, moving the focus indicator elsewhere on the page while the tab retains its
                selected appearance and state.</p>
            <p>Focus and selection are quite different. From the keyboard user's perspective,
                focus is a pointer, like a mouse pointer; it tracks the path of navigation. There is
                only one point of focus at any time and all operations take place at the point of
                focus. On the other hand, selection is an operation that can be performed in some
                widgets, such as list boxes, trees, and tablists. If a widget supports only single
                selection, then only one item can be selected and very often the selected state will
                simply follow the focus when focus is moved inside of the widget. That is, in some
                widgets, moving focus may also perform the select operation. However, if the widget
                supports multiple selection, then more than one item can be in a selected state, and
                keys for moving focus do not perform selection. Some multi-select widgets do support
                key commands that both move focus and change selection, but those keys are different
                from the normal navigation keys. Finally, when focus leaves a widget that includes a
                selected element, the selected state persists.</p>
            <p>
                From the developer's perspective, the difference is simple -- the focused element is
                the active element (document.activeElement). Selected elements are elements that
                have
                <code>aria-selected="true"</code>
                .
            </p>
            <p>With respect to focus and the selected state, the most important considerations
                for designers and developers are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The visual focus indicator must always be visible.</li>
                <li>The selected state must be visually distinct from the the focus indicator.
                </li>

            <h3>Keyboard Navigation Between Components (The Tab Sequence)</h3>
            <p>
                As explained in section <a href="#kbd_generalnav"></a>, all interactive UI
                components need to be reachable vai the keyboard. This is best achieved by either
                including them in the tab sequence or by making them accessible from a component
                that is in the tab sequence, e.g., as part of a composite component. This section
                addresses building and managing the tab sequence, and subsequent sections cover
                making focusable elements that are contained within components keyboard accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#attr-tabindex">HTML
                    tabindex</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#tabindexattribute">SVG
                    tabindex</a> attributes can be used to add and remove elements from the tab
                sequence. The value of tabindex can also influence the order of the tab sequence,
                although authors are strongly advised not to use tabindex for that purpose.
            </p>
            <p>In HTML, the default tab sequence of a web page includes only links and HTML form
                elements, except In Mac OS, where it includes only form elements. Mac OS system
                preferences include a keyboard setting that enables the tab key to move focus to all
                focusable elements.</p>
            <p>
                The default order of elements in the tab sequence is the order of elements in the
                DOM. The DOM order also determines screen reader reading order. It is important to
                keep the keyboard tab sequence and the screen reader reading order aligned, logical,
                and predictable as described in <a href="#kbd_focus_discernable_predictable"></a>.
                The most robust method of manipulating the order of the tab sequence while also
                maintaining alignment with the reading order that is currently available in all
                browsers is rearranging elements in the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>The values of the tabindex attribute have the following effects.</p>

      <h3> Keyboard Navigation Inside Components</h3>
      <p>
      As described in section <a href="#kbd_generalnav"></a>, the tab sequence should include only one focusable element of a composite UI component.
      Once a composite contains focus, keys other than <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbe>Shift+Tab</kbe> enable the user to move focus among its focusable elements.
      Authors are free to choose which keys move focus inside of a composite, but they are strongly advised to use the same key bindings as similar components in common GUI operating systems as demonstrated in <a
                    href="#aria_ex"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The convention for where focus lands in a composite when it recieves focus as a result of a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key event depends on the type of composite.
      It is typically one of the following.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      The element that had focus the last time the composite contained focus. 
      Or, if the composite has not yet contained the focus, the first element.
      Widgets that usually employ this pattern include grid and tree grid.
      </li>
      <li>
      The selected element. Or, if there is no selected element, the first element.
      Widgets where this pattern is commonly implemented include radio groups, tabs, list boxes, and trees.
      Note: For radio groups, this pattern is referring to the checked radio button; the selected state is not supported for radio buttons.
      </li>
      <li>
      The first element.
      Components that typically follow this pattern include menubars and toolbars.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The following sections explain two strategies for managing focus inside composite elements: creating a roving tabindex and using the aria-activedescendant property. 
      </p>
      <section id="kbd_roving_tabindex">
      <h4>Managing Focus Within Components Using a Roving tabindex</h4>
      <p>
      When using roving tabindex to manage focus in a composite UI component, the element that is to be included in the tab sequence has tabindex of "0" and all other focusable elements contained in the composite have tabindex of "-1".
      The algorithm for the roving tabindex strategy is as follows. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the component container is loaded or created, set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the element that will initially be included in the tab sequence and set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on all other focusable elements it contains.</li>
        <li>When the component contains focus and the user presses a navigation key that moves focus within the component, such as an arrow key:
        <ul>
                            <li>set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on the element that has <code>tabindex="0"</code>.</li>
                            <li>Set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the element that will become focused as a result of the key event.</li>
                            <li>Set focus, <code>element.focus()</code>, on the element that has <code>tabindex="0"</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If the design calls for a specific element to be focused the next time the user moves focus into the composite with <kbd>Tab<kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>,
                    check if that target element has <code>tabindex="0"</code> when the composite loses focus. 
                     If it does not, set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the target element and set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on the element that previously had <code>tabindex="0"</code>.
                    </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      One benefit of using roving tabindex rather than aria-activedescendant to manage focus is that the user agent will scroll the newly focused element into view.
      </p>
    </section>
      <section id="kbd_focus_activedescendant">
      <h4>Managing Focus in Composites Using aria-activedescendant</h4>
      <p>
      If a component container has an ARIA role that supports the <a class="property-reference"
                        href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property, it is not necessary to manipulate the tabindex attribute and move DOM focus among focusable elements within the container.
      Instead, only the container element needs to be included in the tab sequence. When the container has DOM focus, the value of aria-activedescendant on the container tells assistive technologies which element is active within the widget.
      Assistive technologies will consider the element referred to as active to be the focused element even though DOM focus is on the element that has the aria-activedescendant property.
      And, when the value of aria-activedescendant is changed, assistive technologies will receive focus change events equivalent to those received when DOM focus actually moves.
      </p>
      <p>
      The steps for using the aria-activedescendant method of managing focus are as follows.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>When the container element that has a role that supports aria-activedescendant is loaded or created, ensure that:
      <ul>
      <li>The container element is included in the tab sequence as described in <a
                                href="#kbd_general_between"></a> or it is otherwise focusable as described in <a
                                href="#kbd_nested_components"></a>.</li>
      <li>It has <code>aria-activedescendant="IDREF"</code> where IDREF is the ID of the element within the container that should be identified as active when the widget receives focus. The referenced element needs to meet the DOM relationship requirements described below.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When the container element receives DOM focus, draw a visual focus indicator on the active element and ensure the active element is scrolled into view. See section <a
                        href="#scrollintoview">Managing Focus with Scroll</a> below for more information.
      </li>
      <li>When the composite widget contains focus and the user presses a navigation key that moves focus within the widget, such as an arrow key:
      <ul>
      <li>Change the value of aria-activedescendant on the container to refer to the element that should be reported to assistive technologies as active.</li>
      <li>Move the visual focus indicator and, if necessary,  scrolled the active element into view.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If the design calls for a specific element to be focused the next time a user moves focus into the composite with <kbd>Tab<kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>,
                    check if aria-activedescendant is referring to that target element when the container loses focus. 
                     If it is not, set aria-activedescendant to refer to the target element.
                    </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      The <a href="#aria-activedescendant" class="property-reference">specification for aria-activedescendant</a> places important restrictions on the DOM relationship between the focused element that has the aria-activedescendant attribute and the element referenced as active by the value of the attribute.
      One of the following three conditions must be met.
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>The element referenced as active is a DOM descendant of the focused referencing element.</li>
      <li>The focused referencing element has a value specified for the <a href="#aria-owns"
                        class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property that includes the ID of the element referenced as active. </li>
      <li>The focused referencing element has role of <a href="#textbox" class="role-reference">textbox</a> and has <a
                        href="#aria-controls" class="property-reference">aria-controls</a> property referring to an element with a role that supports aria-activedescendant and either:
      <ol>
      <li>The element referenced as active is a descendant of the controlled element.</li>
      <li>The controlled element has a value specified for the <a href="#aria-owns"
                                class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property that includes the ID of the element referenced as active. </li>

      <h5>Managing Focus with Scroll</h5>
      <p class="note">Not yet edited ... considering what should be written/included. We don't want to write a javascript book.</p>
      <p>In some browsers, a JavaScript call to <code> scrollIntoView()</code> on this element should suffice, but in browsers where   this is unreliable, authors should explicitly set the <code>scrollTop</code> and <code>scrollLeft</code> properties of the "cell23" element and its ancestors to scroll the element into view. <code>scrollTop</code> and <code>scrollLeft</code> adjust the node positions by the amounts(pixels) needed to scroll a node into view.  Scrolling values are adjusted by the amounts(pixels) needed
        to scroll a node into view. This is done by comparing the sizes of the nodes
        using available measurements such as scroll+offset+clientWidth/Height/Left/Top. It's important to note that you have to adjust a node so that it's viewable within
        the context of its parent node.  Then you have to move up the DOM tree and make
        each parent node visible.</p>
      <p>For example, create a custom <code> scrollIntoView()</code> method that is called at various   times, including coincidence with the setting of the <a
                        class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property. The method takes a DOM node   argument, say "n". Here is the high level algorithm: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> If n is already in view, stop; otherwise, continue. </li>
        <li> adjust n.scrollTop and n.scrollLeft such that it is in view. </li>
        <li>adjust scrollTop and scrollLeft for the ancestor nodes of n such that   that the region of the ancestors which n consumes is visible.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is a minimum-position-change algorithm. </p>
      <p>Understanding how the DOM scrollIntoView works across browsers is important.
        Browsers (including Firefox3) force the node either to the top or the bottom of the screen (as defined by the single Boolean parameter) even if its already in view. This is problematic when you only need to scroll horizontally to see the element. It is also problematic when  the node is partially off the bottom of the screen and the parameter is (true) which forces the node all the way to the top, and vice versa with the top going to the bottom on (false). IE forces the node to the left of the client area (or right in right-to-left mode) even if it's horizontally in view already. </p>
      <p>The <code>scrollTop</code> and<code> scrollLeft</code> functions create some challenges. <code>scrollTop</code> is always accurate but misleading with respect to inner (nested) scrollbars.<code> scrollLeft</code> cannot be relied on in right-to-left languages because it is sometimes negative and sometimes positive especially with respect to inner (nested) scrollbars. Different browsers handle right-to-left completely differently. </p>

 <h3>Managing Focus in Dialogs</h3>
 <p class="note">
 MCK: unedited content pulled together from the old guide that needs a significant re-write. Please ignore this section for now.
 </p>
<p>
WAI-ARIA provides for two dialog roles - dialog and alertdialog. When authors simulate dialogs on a web page they often limit their interaction considerations to the mouse. Unlike Graphical User Interface dialog boxes on a desktop computer, a user during keyboard navigation could accidentally navigate outside the dialog box and become disoriented. This can happen when the user is tabbing in the dialog. A modal dialog prevents the user from setting focus outside of the dialog until the dialog is closed. Mouse clicks outside of the dialog must be ignored and the user must not be able to tab into or out of the dialog itself. All WAI-ARIA enabled dialog boxes should be modal. This section describes how.
</p>
<p>
Mouse clicks outside of the dialog can be prevented by creating a CSS positioned element that is the size of the viewport to append as a child of the body element. Set the CSS z-index of this element so that it is above all other elements on the page except for the dialog element. Set the tabindex of the underlay element to tabindex="-1" to prevent it from receiving focus via a keyboard event or mouse click. You may lower the opacity of the underlay element in order to emphasize that the dialog itself is modal and has focus.
</p>
<p>
Depending upon the action to be performed by the dialog, the object with focus before the dialog box is opened should be saved. This will allow restoring focus to this element when the dialog box is closed. When the dialog box is opened, focus should be set to the first tab focusable element within the dialog. If there is no tab focusable element within the dialog box contents, set the focus to the item that is used to cancel or close the dialog. There must be some element within the dialog which can accept focus in order for the screen reader to speak the dialog title and information when it is opened. In order to prevent keyboard focus from leaving the dialog, determine the first and last tab focusable elements in the dialog and trap keyboard events within the document.
</p>
<p>
Search the contents of the dialog container to find the first and last tab focusable elements. This can be implemented by walking the DOM tree of the dialog container to find all visible and enabled anchor elements, input elements, and all elements that have a tabindex value greater than or equal to 0. Remember that elements with a tabindex > 0 will appear in the tab order before all other focusable elements in ascending order by tabindex. Store the first and last tab focusable items within variables in the scope of the dialog box code.
</p>
<p>
Before the dialog is shown, create and display the dialog underlay. Connect an onkeypress event handler to the DOM document.documentElement. This will catch all keystrokes on the document and allow trapping keyboard focus within the dialog. Size and position the dialog box in the viewport above the underlay, make it visible and set focus to the first tab focusable item in the dialog box.
</p>
<p>
The onkeypress handler will catch all key presses within the document. This onkeypress event handler should be within the scope of the dialog box code so that it has access to the first and last tab focusable elements within the dialog. In the onkeypress handler determine the target of the keypress event. In addition, determine if there is only a single focusable item within the dialog box. In this instance the first tab navigable object will equal the last tab navigable object. If key presses within the dialog box may create, destroy, enable, disable, or change the visibility of tab focusable elements, then determine the first and last tab-focusable items each time a keypress is received. Based on the event target and the key pressed take the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the keypress is a <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> key and the target == the first tab navigable object, then set focus to the last tab-navigable object and stop the key press event. If there is only a single tab focusable item, then focus does not have to be set, but the key press event must be stopped.
</li>
<li>
If the keypress is a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and the target == the last tab navigable object, then set focus to the first tab-navigable object and stop the keypress event. If there is only a single tab-focusable item, then focus does not have to be set but the keypress event must must be stopped.
</li>
<li>
If the keypress is an <kbd>Escape</kbd> key and the target node is the container node for the dialog box, then close the dialog box and hide or destroy the dialog underlay.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Determine if the target node of the keypress is within the dialog box container. This can be done using a while loop to walk the parent chain of the target node until the container node of the dialog box is found. Other than those outlined above, all key presses from within the dialog box should be allowed to execute so that the user can interact with the controls in the dialog box.
</p>
<p>
If the target node is not within the dialog box, the keypress is from the documentElement and the keypress event should be stopped unless it is a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key press. Allowing a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key press from the document element will enable tabbing back into the dialog box if, for some reason, focus on the dialog box is lost. This can happen due to timing issues when the dialog box is first loaded and focus does not properly get set to the first tab-focusable item within the dialog.
</p>
<p>
The dialog box itself should contain buttons or other mechanisms to cancel the dialog box or execute the dialog box functions and close the dialog box.
</p>
<p>
Here is a pseudo code onkeypress handler for a modal dialog box. Pseudo code is used to focus on the actions in the handler rather than on the differences in browser event handling. Assume that the event object, evt, has been normalized between browsers and the helper object is a library of functions that handle browser differences. The keys object is a set of key definition variables. Dialog is the dialog box object, which has a function to cancel the dialog.
</p>
<pre>
_onKey: function(/*Normalized Event*/ evt){
// summary:
// Handles the keyboard events for accessibility reasons
if(evt.charOrCode){
var node = evt.target; // get the target node of the keypress event
if (evt.charOrCode === keys.TAB){
// find the first and last tab focusable items in the hierarchy of the dialog container node
// do this every time if the items may be added / removed from the the dialog may change visibility or state
var focusItemsArray = helper.getFocusItems(dialogContainerNode);
dialog.firstFocusItem = focusItemsArray[0];
dialog.lastFocusItem = focusItemsArray[focusItemsArray.length-1];
}
// assumes firstFocusItem and lastFocusItem maintained by dialog object
var singleFocusItem = (dialog.firstFocusItem == dialog.lastFocusItem);

// see if we are shift-tabbing from first focusable item on dialog
if(node == dialog.firstFocusItem &amp;&amp; evt.shiftKey &amp;&amp; evt.charOrCode === keys.TAB){
if(!singleFocusItem){
dialog.lastFocusItem.focus(); // send focus to last item in dialog
}
helper.stopEvent(evt); //stop the tab keypress event
}
// see if we are tabbing from the last focusable item
else if(node == dialog.lastFocusItem &amp;&amp; evt.charOrCode === keys.TAB &amp;&amp; !evt.shiftKey){
if (!singleFocusItem){
dialog.firstFocusItem).focus(); // send focus to first item in dialog
}
helper.stopEvent(evt); //stop the tab keypress event
}
else{
// see if the key is for the dialog
while(node){
if(node == dialogContainerNode){ // if this is the container node of the dialog
if(evt.charOrCode == keys.ESCAPE){ // and the escape key was pressed
dialog.cancel(); // cancel the dialog
}else{
return; // just let it go
}
}
node = node.parentNode;
}
// this key is for the document window
if(evt.charOrCode !== keys.TAB){ // allow tabbing into the dialog
helper.stopEvent(evt); //stop the event if not a tab keypress
}
} // end of if evt.charOrCode
} // end of function

    <h3>Focusability of disabled controls</h3>
    <p>
    By default, disabled HTML input elements are removed from the tab sequence.  
    In most contexts, the normal expectation is that disabled interactive elements are not focusable. 
    However, there are some contexts where it is common for disabled elements to be focusable, especially inside of composite widgets.  
    For example, as demonstrated in the <a href="#menu"></a> pattern, disabled items are focusable when navigating through a menu with the arrow keys.
    </p>
    <p>
    Removing focusability from disabled elements can offer users both advantages and disadvantages.
    Allowing keyboard users to skip disabled elements usually reduces the number of key presses required to complete a task.
    However, preventing focus from moving to disabled elements can hide their presence from screen reader users who "see" by moving the focus. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Authors are encouraged to adopt a consistent set of conventions for the focusability of disabled elements. 
    The examples in this guide adopt the following conventions, which both reflect common practice and attempt to balance competing concerns.
    </p>
    <ol>
    <li>For elements that are in the tab sequence when enabled, remove them from the tab sequence when disabled. </li>
    <li>For the following composite widget elements, keep them focusable when disabled:
    <ul>
      <li>Options in a <a href="Listbox">Listbox</a></li>
      <li>Menu items in a <a href="#menu">Menu or menu bar</a></li>
      <li>Tab elements in a set of <a href="#tabpanel">Tabs</a></li>
      <li>Tree items in a <a href="#TreeView">Tree View</a></li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>For elements contained in a toolbar, make them focusable if discoverability is a concern. Here are two examples to aid with this judgment.
    <ol>
    <li>
    A toolbar with buttons for moving, removing, and adding items in a list includes buttons for &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Add&quot;, and &quot;Remove&quot;. 
    The &quot;Up&quot; button is disabled and its focusability is removed when the first item in the list is selected. 
    Given the  presence of the &quot;Down&quot; button, discoverability of the &quot;Up&quot; button is not a concern.
    </li>
    <li>
    A toolbar in an editor contains a set of special smart paste functions that are disabled when the clipboard is empty or when the function is not applicable to the current content of the clipboard. 
    It could be helpful to keep the disabled buttons focusable if the ability to discover their functionality is primarily via their presence on the toolbar.
    </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    One design technique for mitigating the impact of including disabled elements in the path of keyboard focus is employing appropriate keyboard shortcuts as described in <a
                    href="#kbd_shortcuts"></a>.
    </p>

      <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
      <p>
      When effectively designed, keyboard shortcuts that focus an element, activate a widget, or both can dramatically enhance usability of frequently used features of a page or site. 
      This section addresses some of the keyboard shortcut design and implementation factors that most impact their effectiveness, including:
      </p>
      <ol>
      <li>Understanding how keyboard shortcuts augment a keyboard interface and whether to make a particular shortcut move focus, perform a function, or both. </li>

      <h4>Designing the Scope and Behavior of Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
      <p>This section explains the following factors when determining which elements and features to assign keyboard shortcuts and what behavior to give each shortcut:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Ensuring discovery through navigation; keyboard shortcuts enhance, not replace, standard keyboard access.</li>
      <li>Effectively choosing from among the following behaviors:
      <ol>
      <li>Navigation: Moving focus to an element. </li>
      <li>Activation: Performing an operation associated with an element that does not have focus and might not be visible.</li>
      <li>Navigation and activation: Both moving focus to an element and activating it. </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Balancing efficiency and cognitive load: lack of a shortcut can reduce efficiency while too many shortcuts can increase cognitive load and clutter the experience. </li>
      </ol>
      <section id="kbd_shortcuts_design_basic">
      <h5>Ensure Basic Access Via Navigation </h5>
      <p>
      Before assigning keyboard shortcuts, it is essential to ensure the features and functions to which shortcuts may be assigned are keyboard accessible without a keyboard shortcut.
      In other words, all elements that could be targets for keyboard shortcuts need to be focusable via the keyboard using the methods described in:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="#kbd_general_between"></a> </li>
      <li><a href="#kbd_general_within"></a> </li>
      </ul>
<p>      
Do not use keyboard shortcuts as a substitute for access via navigation. 
This is essential to full keyboard access because:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The primary means of making functions and their shortcuts discoverable is by making the target elements focusable and revealing key assignments on the element itself. </li>
<li>If people who rely on the keyboard have to read documentation to learn which keys are required to use an interface, the interface may technically meet some accessibility standards but in practice is only accessible to the small subset of them who have the knowledge that such documentation exists, have the extra time available, and the ability to retain the necessary information. </li>
<li>Not all devices that depend on keyboard interfaces can support keyboard shortcuts. </li>

Move focus when the primary objective is to make navigation more efficient, e.g., reduce the number of times the user must press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or the arrow keys.
This behavior is commonly expected when assigning a shortcut to a text box, toolbar, or composite, such as a listbox, tree, grid, or menubar.
This behavior is also useful for moving focus to a section of a page, such as the main content or a complementary landmark section.
</li>
<li>
Activate an element without moving focus when the target context of the funtion is the context that contains the focus.
This behavior is most common for command buttons and for functions associated with elements that are not visible, such as a "Save" option that is accessible via a menu.
For example, if the focus is on an option in a listbox and a toolbar contains buttons for moving and removing options, it is most benefitial to keep focus in the listbox when the user presses a key shortcut for one of the buttons in the toolbar.
This behavior can be particularly important for screen reader users because it provides confirmation of the action performed and makes performing multiple commands more efficient.
For instance, when a screen reader user presses the shortcut for the "Up" button, the user will be able to hear the new position of the option in the list since it still has the focus.
Similarly, when the user presses the shortcut for deleting an option, the user can hear the next option in the list and immediately decide whether to press the delete shortcut again.
</li>
<li>
Move focus and activate when the target of the shortcut has a single function and the context of that function is the same as the target. 
This behavior is typical when a shortcut is assigned to a button that opens a menu or dialog, to a checkbox, or to a navigation link or button.

<h5>Choose Where to Add Shortcuts </h5>
<p>
The first goal when designing a keyboard interface is simple, efficient, and and intuitive operation with only basic keyboard navigation support.
If basic operation of a keyboard interface is inefficient , attempting to compensate for fundamental design issues, such as suboptimal layout or command structure,  by implementing keyboard shortcuts will not likely reduce user frustration.
The practical implication of this is that, in most well-designed user interfaces, the percentage of functionality that needs to be accessible via a keyboard shortcut in order to create optimal usability is not very high.
In many simple user interfaces, keyboard shortcuts can be entirely superfluous.
And, in user interfaces with too many keyboard shortcuts, the excess shortcuts create cognitive load that make the most useful ones more difficult to remember. 
</p>
<p>Consider the following when deciding where to assign keyboard shortcuts: </p>
<ol>
<li>To be written ... stream of consciousness includes frequency of use, repetitive operations, amount of benefit (key presses saved), minimizing the number with placement, e.g., focus on a menubar with first letter nav vs assigning shortcuts to individual menuitems.</li>

      <h4>Assigning Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
      <p>When choosing the keys to assign to a shortcut, there are many factors to consider.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Making the shortcut easy to learn and remember by using a mnemonic (e.g., "S" for "Save") or following a logical or spacial pattern.</li>
      <li> Localizing the interface, including for differences in which keys are available and how they behave and for language considerations that could impact mnemonics. </li>
      <li>Avoiding and managing conflicts with key assignments used by an assistive technology, the browser, or the operating system.</li>
      </ul>
                <p>
                Methods for designing a key shortcut scheme that supports learning and memory is beyond the scope of this guide. 
                Unless the key shortcut scheme is extensive, it is likely sufficient to mimic concepts that are familiar from common desktop software, such as browsers. 
                Similarly, while localization is important, describing how to address it is left to other resources that specialize in that topic.

                The remainder of this section provides guidance balancing requirements and concerns related to key assignment conflicts.
                It is typically ideal if key assignments do not conflict with keys that are assigned to functions in the user's operating system, browser, or assistive technology.
                    Conflicts can block efficient access to functions that are essential to the user, and a perfect storm of conflicts can trap a user. 
                    At the same time, there are some circumstances where intentional conflicts are useful.
                    And, given the vast array of operating system, browser, and assistive technology keys, it is almost impossible to be certain conflicts do not exist.
                    So it is also important to employ strategies that mitigate the impact of conflicts whether they are intentional or unknown.

                    <p>
                    It is essential to avoid conflicts with keys that perform system level functions, such as appplication and window management and display and sound control. 
                    In general, this can be achieved by refraining from the following types of assignments.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Any modifier keys + any of <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd>, or <kbd>Escape</kbd>. </li>
                    <li><kbd>Meta</kbd> key + any other single key (there are exceptions, but they can be risky as these keys can change across versions of operating systems). </li>
                    <li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + a function key. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                    In addition, there are some important application level features that most applications, including browsers, generally support.
                    These include:

                    <p>
                    Even though assistive technologies have collectively taken thousands of key assignments, avoiding conflicts is relatively easy.
                    This is because assistive technologies have had to develop key assignment schemes that avoid conflicts with both operating systems and applications.
                    They do this by hijacking specific keys as modifiers that uniquely define their key commands.
                    For example, many assistive technologies use the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key as a modifier.

                    <p>
                    While there is considerable similarity among browser keyboard schemes, the patterns within the schemes are less homogenious.
                    Consequently, it is more difficult to avoid conflicts with browser key assignments.
                    While the impact of conflicts is sometimes mitigated by the availability of two paths to nearly every function -- keyboard accessible menus and keyboard shortcuts, avoiding conflicts with shortcuts to heavily used functions is nonetheless important.

                    <p>While avoiding key conflicts is usually desirable, there are
                        circumstances where intentionally conflicting with a browser function is
                        acceptable or even desirable. This can occur when the following combination

    <h4>Miscelaneous stuff we might or might not keep</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Use focus and blur events (or event delegation) to monitor changes to the current focus</em> - <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> events can now be used with every element. 
          Don't assume that all focus changes will come via key and mouse events, because assistive technologies such as screen readers can set the focus to any focusable element, and that needs to be handled elegantly by the JavaScript widget. 
          Techniques such as &quot;event delegation&quot; (for example, intercepting events on a list rather than on every listitem) can improve performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Follow keydowns to move focus</em> - A keydown event handler can determine the next object to receive focus and call that element's focus() method. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Use onkeydown to trap key events, not onkeypress</em> - Key press events do not fire for all keys and they vary across browsers. 
        </li>
<li>
          <em>Use element.focus() to set focus</em> - Do not use createEvent(), initEvent() and dispatchEvent() to send focus to an element, because these functions do not change the focus.  DOM focus events are informational only, generated by the user agent after an element has acquired focus, but not used themselves to set focus.
        </li>
<li>
          The use of :focus pseudo-class selectors to style the keyboard focus is not supported in many versions of Internet Explorer. Authors should use the :active pseudo-class (which older versions of IE treat like :focus) in conjunction with the :focus pseudo-class. Example: a:focus, a:active { text-decoration: underline; } 
      If the related CSS pseudo-classes are not appropriate or not supported in all browsers, authors can use JavaScript techniques to indicate an appropriate focus alternative, such as using focus and blur events to toggle a classname on an element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Always draw the focus for tabindex="-1" items and elements that receive focus programmatically when supporting versions of Internet Explorer older than 8</em> - Choose between changing the background  color via something like this.style.backgroundColor = "gray"; or add a dotted border via this.style.border = "1px dotted invert".  In the dotted border case, you will need to make sure those elements  have an invisible 1px border to start with, so that the element doesn't  grow when the border style is applied (borders take up space, and IE  doesn't implement CSS outlines). 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
                            <em>Prevent used key events from performing browser functions</em> - If a key such as an arrow key is used, prevent the browser from using the key to do something (such as scrolling) by using code like the following:</p>
          <pre class="example highlight">&lt;span tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; onkeypress=&quot;return  handleKeyPress();&quot;&gt; </pre>
          <p>If handleKeyDown() returns false, the event will be consumed, preventing the browser from performing any action based on the keystroke.  In addition to the return value the browser must call the event methods that will prevent the default action, for IE this is setting the event property &quot;returnValue=false&quot;, and for other browsers supporting the W3C event model this means calling the &quot;preventDefault&quot; method of the event object.</p>
          </li>
        <li>
            <em>Use key event handlers to enable activation of the element</em> - For every mouse event handler, a keyboard event handler is required. 
            For example, if you have an <em>onclick="doSomething()"</em> you may also need <em>onkeydown="return event.keyCode != 13 || doSomething();" </em>in order to allow the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to activate that element. 
          There are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets" target="_blank">user agent-specific considerations</a> for key event handling.

        <h3> Supporting Tooltips with the Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
        A <a class="role-reference" href="#tooltip">tooltip</a> is a  popup messages typically triggered by moving a mouse over a control or widget causing a small popup window to appear with additional information about the control. 
        To provide simple text tooltips, the <a
                        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/global.html#h-7.4.3">HTML title attribute</a> should more than suffice because the user agent will render it for tooltips. 
        When creating a <a class="role-reference" href="#tooltip">tooltip</a>, it is essential that  the user be able to activate it using the keyboard. 
        When a form control or widget receives keyboard focus, the <a class="role-reference"
                        href="#tooltip">tooltip</a> must display. 
        When the form control or widget loses focus, the tooltip must disappear. 
        Browsers do not currently support this functionality.
