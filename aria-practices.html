    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) explains how to create accessible web experiences for users of assistive technologies and keyboard interfaces by developing web sites that properly convey accessibility semantics and implement common keyboard conventions.
      It also provides guidance on some closely related topics, such as supporting operating system settings for high contrast and reduced motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accessibility semantics refer to the meaning of user interface elements that need to be conveyed to assistive technology users in order for those users to understand and use the elements.
      For example, people who can visually perceive a search icon button understand the element can be activated to perform a search by the way it is styled and positioned.
      To make that icon accessible to a screen reader user, one of the semantics that needs to be communicated is that the element represents an interactive button.
      In addition, keyboard accessibility requires the button to be focusable, and keyboard conventions call for pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to activate the button when it is focused.
      The APG describes how to convey accessibility semantics and implement keyboard accessibility for many common design patterns, ranging from typical buttons and popup menus to complex tree grids.
      It also explains essential practices related to these patterns, such as how to convey web page structure with ARIA landmark regions and effectively utilize the many ways of encoding accessible names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The APG is organized into two major sections: patterns and practices.
      Each pattern explains how to make a common user interface element, such as a button, menu, or dialog, accessible, and provides functional example implementations of the pattern.
      The practices section gives in-depth explanation of how to satisfy a variety of accessibility needs that surface when making rich internet application experiences accessible.
      For instance, the practices section on providing accessible names and descriptions gives detailed descriptions of seven different naming techniques as well as a table providing guidance for naming more than 80 types of elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The APG assumes basic understanding of web development, especially of HTML and CSS.
      It may be particularly useful to designers and engineers who are working on site design systems and component libraries.
      However, it is important to understand that the APG only covers a portion of what is needed to create accessible experiences.
      To understand accessibility more broadly, it is advisable to start with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">WAI Accessibility Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/design-develop/">WAI Overview of Design and Development</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accessibility semantics used in the APG patterns and described in APG practices are defined in the
      <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/">WAI-ARIA 1.2 Specification</a></cite>.
      That is, the ARIA specification standardizes the meaning of the attributes that describe elements and their states to assistive technologies, such as the meaning of <code>role="button"</code>.
      These attributes and other features required to make sites usable by people who rely on assistive technologies or keyboard navigation are not natively included in the languages used to create web sites, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SVG.
      The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications working group (ARIA WG) is addressing these deficiencies through several W3C standards efforts.
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>
      provides additional background on WAI-ARIA, summarizes those efforts, and lists the other documents included in the WAI-ARIA suite.

    <h2>Read Me First</h2>
    <section id="no_aria_better_bad_aria">
      <h3>No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA</h3>
      <p>
        Functionally, ARIA roles, states, and properties are analogous to a CSS for assistive technologies.
        For screen reader users, ARIA controls the rendering of their non-visual experience.
        Incorrect ARIA misrepresents visual experiences, with potentially devastating effects on their corresponding non-visual experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Before using ARIA or any of the guidance in this document, please take time to understand the following two essential principles.</p>
      <h4>Principle 1: A role is a promise</h4>
      <p>This code:</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div role=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Place Order&lt;/div&gt;
          </code> </pre>
      <p>
        Is a promise that the author of that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has also incorporated JavaScript that provides the keyboard interactions expected for a button.
        Unlike HTML input elements, ARIA roles do not cause browsers to provide keyboard behaviors or styling.
      </p>
      <p>Using a role without fulfilling the promise of that role is similar to making a &quot;Place Order&quot; button that abandons an order and empties the shopping cart.</p>
      <p>One of the objectives of this guide is to define expected behaviors for each ARIA role.</p>
      <h4>Principle 2: ARIA Can Both Cloak and Enhance, Creating Both Power and Danger</h4>
      <p>
        The information assistive technologies need about the meaning and purpose of user interface elements is called accessibility semantics.
        From the perspective of assistive technologies, ARIA gives authors the ability to dress up HTML and SVG elements with critical accessibility semantics that the assistive technologies would not otherwise be able to reliably derive.
      </p>
      <p>Some of ARIA is like a cloak; it covers up, or overrides, the original semantics or content.</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;a role=&quot;menuitem&quot;&gt;Assistive tech users perceive this element as an item in a menu, not a link.&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a aria-label=&quot;Assistive tech users can only perceive the contents of this aria-label, not the link text&quot;&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>On the other hand, some uses of ARIA are more like suspenders or belts; they add meaning that provides essential support to the original content.</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;button aria-pressed=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Mute&lt;/button&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This is the power of ARIA.
        It enables authors to describe nearly any user interface component in ways that assistive technologies can reliably interpret, thus making components accessible to assistive technology users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also the danger of ARIA.
        Authors can inadvertently override accessibility semantics.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;table role=&quot;log&quot;&gt;
            &lt;!--
              Table that assistive technology users will not perceive as a table.
              The log role tells browser this is a log, not a table.
            --&gt;
          &lt;/table&gt;
          &lt;ul role=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
            &lt;!-- This is a navigation region, not a list. --&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;uri1&quot;&gt;nav link 1&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;uri2&quot;&gt;nav link 2&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;!-- ERROR! Previous list items are not in a list! --&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Browser and Assistive Technology Support</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Testing assistive technology interoperability is essential before using code from this guide in production.</strong>
        Because the purpose of this guide is to illustrate appropriate use of ARIA 1.2 as defined in the ARIA specification, the design patterns, reference examples, and sample code intentionally <strong>do not</strong> describe and implement coding techniques for working around problems caused by gaps in support for ARIA 1.2 in browsers and assistive technologies.
        It is thus advisable to test implementations thoroughly with each browser and assistive technology combination that is relevant within a target audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, JavaScript and CSS in this guide is written to be compatible with the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari at the time of writing.
Some JavaScript and CSS may not function correctly in Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except in cases where the ARIA Working Group and other contributors have overlooked an error,
        examples in this guide that do not function well in a particular browser or with a specific assistive technology are demonstrating browser or assistive technology bugs.
        Browser and assistive technology developers can thus utilize code in this guide to help assess the quality of their support for ARIA 1.2.

      <h3>Mobile and Touch Support</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, this guide does not indicate which examples are compatible with mobile browsers or touch interfaces.
        While some of the examples include specific features that enhance mobile and touch support, some ARIA features are not supported in any mobile browser.
        In addition, there is not yet a standardized approach for providing touch interactions that work across mobile browsers.
      </p>
      <p>More guidance about touch and mobile support is planned for future releases of the guide.</p>

    <h2>Developing a Keyboard Interface</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with ARIA; authors have to provide the keyboard support in their code.
      This section describes the principles and methods for making the functionality of a web page that includes ARIA widgets, such as menus and grids, as well as interactive components, such as toolbars and dialogs, operable with a keyboard.
      Along with the basics of focus management, this section offers guidance toward the objective of providing experiences to people who rely on a keyboard that are as efficient and enjoyable as the experiences available to others.
    </p>
      <p>This section covers: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Understanding fundamental principles of focus movement conventions used in ARIA design patterns.</li>
      <li>Maintaining visible focus, predictable focus movement, and distinguishing between keyboard focus and the selected state.</li>
      <li>Managing movement of keyboard focus between components, e.g., how the focus moves when the <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> keys are pressed.</li>
      <li>Managing movement of keyboard focus inside components that contain multiple focusable elements, e.g., two different methods for programmatically exposing focus inside widgets like radio groups, menus, listboxes, trees, and grids.</li>
      <li>Determining when to make disabled interactive elements focusable.</li>
      <li>Assigning and revealing keyboard shortcuts, including guidance on how to avoid problematic conflicts with keyboard commands of assistive technologies, browsers, and operating systems.</li>
    </ol>
    <section id="kbd_generalnav">
      <h3>Fundamental Keyboard Navigation Conventions</h3>

      <p>
        ARIA roles, states, and properties model accessibility behaviors and features shared among GUI components of popular desktop GUIs, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, and GNOME.
        Similarly, ARIA design patterns borrow user expectations and keyboard conventions from those platforms, consistently incorporating common conventions with the aim of facilitating easy learning and efficient operation of keyboard interfaces across the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a web page to be accessible, all interactive elements must be operable via the keyboard.
        In addition, consistent application of the common GUI keyboard interface conventions described in the <a href="#aria_ex">ARIA design patterns</a> is important, especially for assistive technology users.
        Consider, for example, a screen reader user operating a tree.
        Just as familiar visual styling helps users discover how to expand a tree branch with a mouse, ARIA attributes give the tree the sound and feel of a tree in a desktop application.
        So, screen reader users will commonly expect that pressing the right arrow key will expand a collapsed node.
        Because the screen reader knows the element is a tree, it also has the ability to instruct a novice user how to operate it.
        Similarly, voice recognition software can implement commands for expanding and collapsing branches because it recognizes the element as a tree and can execute appropriate keyboard commands.
        All this is only possible if the tree implements the GUI keyboard conventions as described in the <a href="#TreeView">ARIA tree pattern</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A primary keyboard navigation convention common across all platforms is that the <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>shift+tab</kbd> keys move focus from one UI component to another while other keys, primarily the arrow keys, move focus inside of components that include multiple focusable elements.
        The path that the focus follows when pressing the <kbd>tab</kbd> key is known as the tab sequence or tab ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common examples of UI components that contain multiple focusable elements are radio groups, tablists, menus, and grids.
        A radio group, for example, contains multiple radio buttons, each of which is focusable.
        However, only one of the radio buttons is included in the tab sequence.
        After pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key moves focus to a radio button in the group, pressing arrow keys moves focus among the radio buttons in the group, and pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key moves focus out of the radio group to the next element in the tab sequence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ARIA specification refers to a discrete UI component that contains multiple
        focusable elements as a <a href="#composite" class="role-reference">composite</a>
        widget. The process of controlling focus movement inside a composite is called
        managing focus. Following are some ARIA design patterns with example implementations
        that demonstrate focus management:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#combobox">Combobox</a></li>
        <li><a href="#grid">Grid</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Listbox">Listbox</a></li>
        <li><a href="#menu">Menu or menu bar</a></li>
        <li><a href="#radiobutton">Radiogroup</a></li>
        <li><a href="#tabpanel">Tabs</a></li>
        <li><a href="#toolbar">Toolbar</a></li>
        <li>Tree Grid</li>
        <li><a href="#TreeView">Tree View</a></li>
      </ul>

    <section id="kbd_focus_discernable_predictable">
      <h3>Discernible and Predictable Keyboard Focus</h3>
      <p>Work to complete this section is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/217">issue 217.</a></p>
      <p>
        When operating with a keyboard, two essentials of a good experience are the abilities to easily discern the location of the keyboard focus and to discover where focus landed after a navigation key has been pressed.
        The following factors affect to what extent a web page affords users these capabilities.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Visibility of the focus indicator: Users need to be able to easily distinguish the keyboard focus indicator from other features of the visual design. Just as a mouse user may move the mouse to help find the mouse pointer, a keyboard user may press a navigation key to watch for movement. If visual changes in response to focus movement are subtle, many users will lose track of focus and be unable to operate. Authors are advised to rely on the default focus indicators provided by browsers. If overriding the default, consider:
          <ul>
            <li>something about ... Colors and gradients can disappear in high contrast modes.</li>
            <li>Users need to be able to easily distinguish between focus and selection as described in <a href="#kbd_focus_vs_selection"></a>, especially when a component that contains selected elements does not contain the focus.</li>
            <li>... other considerations to be added ...</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li> Persistence of focus: It is essential that there is always a component within the user interface that is active (document.activeElement is not null or is not the body element) and that the active element has a visual focus indicator. Authors need to manage events that effect the currently active element so focus remains visible and moves logically. For example, if the user closes a dialog or performs a destructive operation like deleting an item from a list, the active element may be hidden or removed from the DOM. If such events are not managed to set focus on the button that triggered the dialog or on the list item following the deleted item, browsers move focus to the body element, effectively causing a loss of focus within the user interface. </li>

        <li>
          Predictability of movement: Usability of a keyboard interface is heavily influenced by how readily users can guess where focus will land after a navigation key is pressed.
          Some possible approaches to optimizing predictability include:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Move focus in a pattern that matches the reading order of the page's language. In left to right languages, for example, create a tab sequence that moves focus left to right and then top to bottom.
            </li>

            <li>
              Incorporate all elements of a section of the page in the tab sequence before moving focus to another section. For instance, in a page
              with multiple columns that has content in a left side bar, center region, and right side bar, build a tab sequence that covers all elements in the left sidebar before focus moves to the first focusable element in the center column.
            </li>

            <li>
              When the distance between two consecutive elements in the tab sequence is significant, avoid movement that would be perceived as backward.
              For example, on a page with a left to right language, a jump from the last element in the bottom right of the main content to the top element in a left-hand sidebar is likely to be less predictable and more difficult to follow, especially for users with a narrow field of view.
            </li>

            <li>
              Follow consistent patterns across a site.
              The keyboard experience is more predictable when similar pages have similar focus movement patterns.
            </li>

            <li>Do not set initial focus when the page loads except in cases where:
              <ul>
                <li>The page offers a single, primary function that nearly all users employ immediately after page load.</li>
                <li>Any given user is likely to use the page often.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="kbd_focus_vs_selection">
      <h3>Focus VS Selection and the Perception of Dual Focus</h3>

      <p>
        Occasionally, it may appear as if two elements on the page have focus at the same time.
        For example, in a multi-select list box, when an option is selected it may be greyed.
        Yet, the focus indicator can still be moved to other options, which may also be selected.
        Similarly, when a user activates a tab in a tablist, the selected state is set on the tab and its visual appearance changes.
        However, the user can still navigate, moving the focus indicator elsewhere on the page while the tab retains its selected appearance and state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Focus and selection are quite different.
        From the keyboard user's perspective, focus is a pointer, like a mouse pointer; it tracks the path of navigation.
        There is only one point of focus at any time and all operations take place at the point of focus.
        On the other hand, selection is an operation that can be performed in some widgets, such as list boxes, trees, and tablists.
        If a widget supports only single selection, then only one item can be selected and very often the selected state will simply follow the focus when focus is moved inside of the widget.
        That is, in some widgets, moving focus may also perform the select operation.
        However, if the widget supports multiple selection, then more than one item can be in a selected state, and keys for moving focus do not perform selection.
        Some multi-select widgets do support key commands that both move focus and change selection, but those keys are different from the normal navigation keys.
        Finally, when focus leaves a widget that includes a selected element, the selected state persists.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the developer's perspective, the difference is simple -- the focused element is the active element (document.activeElement).
        Selected elements are elements that have <code>aria-selected="true"</code>.
      </p>

      <p>With respect to focus and the selected state, the most important considerations for designers and developers are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The visual focus indicator must always be visible.</li>
        <li>The selected state must be visually distinct from the focus indicator.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="kbd_selection_follows_focus">
      <h3>Deciding When to Make Selection Automatically Follow Focus</h3>
      <p> in composite widgets where only one element may be selected, such as a tablist or single-select listbox, moving the focus may also cause the focused element to become the selected element. This is called having selection follow focus. Having selection follow focus is often beneficial to users, but in some circumstances, it is extremely detrimental to accessibility. </p>
      <p>
        For example, in a tablist, the selected state is used to indicate which panel is displayed.
        So, when selection follows focus in a tablist, moving focus from one tab to another automatically changes  which panel is displayed.
        If the content of panels is present in the DOM, then displaying a new panel is nearly instantaneous.
        A keyboard user who wishes to display the fourth of six tabs can do so with 3 quick presses of the right arrow.
        And, a screen reader user who perceives the labels on tabs by navigating through them may efficiently read through the complete list without any latency.
      </p>
      <p> However, if displaying a new panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, the effect of having selection automatically focus can be devastating to the experience for keyboard and screen reader users. In this case, displaying the fourth tab or reading through the list becomes a tedious and time-consuming task as the user experiences significant latency with each movement of focus. Further, if displaying a new tab refreshes the page, then the user not only has to wait for the new page to load but also return focus to the tab list. </p>
      <p>
        When selection does not follow focus, the user changes which element is selected by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key.

      <h3>Keyboard Navigation Between Components (The Tab Sequence)</h3>

      <p> As explained in section <a href="#kbd_generalnav"></a>, all interactive UI components need to be reachable via the keyboard. This is best achieved by either including them in the tab sequence or by making them accessible from a component that is in the tab sequence, e.g., as part of a composite component. This section addresses building and managing the tab sequence, and subsequent sections cover making focusable elements that are contained within components keyboard accessible. </p>

      <p>
        The [[HTML]] <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#the-tabindex-attribute">tabindex</a> and [[SVG2]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#tabindexattribute">tabindex</a> attributes can be used to add and remove elements from the tab sequence.
        The value of tabindex can also influence the order of the tab sequence, although authors are strongly advised not to use tabindex for that purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        In HTML, the default tab sequence of a web page includes only links and HTML form elements, except In macOS, where it includes only form elements.
        macOS system preferences include a keyboard setting that enables the tab key to move focus to all focusable elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default order of elements in the tab sequence is the order of elements in the DOM.
        The DOM order also determines screen reader reading order.
        It is important to keep the keyboard tab sequence and the screen reader reading order aligned, logical, and predictable as described in <a href="#kbd_focus_discernable_predictable"></a>.
        The most robust method of manipulating the order of the tab sequence while also maintaining alignment with the reading order that is currently available in all browsers is rearranging elements in the DOM.
      </p>

      <p>The values of the tabindex attribute have the following effects.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>tabindex is not present or does not have a valid value</dt>
        <dd>
          The element has its default focus behavior.
          In HTML, only form controls and anchors with an HREF attribute are included in the tab sequence.
        </dd>
        <dt>tabindex="0"</dt>
        <dd>The element is included in the tab sequence based on its position in the DOM.</dd>
        <dt>tabindex="-1"</dt>
        <dd>The element is not included in the tab sequence but is focusable with element.focus().</dd>
        <dt>tabindex="X" where X is an integer in the range 1 &lt;= X &lt;= 32767</dt>
        <dd>
          Authors are strongly advised NOT to use these values.
          The element is placed in the tab sequence based on the value of tabindex.
          Elements with a tabindex value of 0 and elements that are focusable by default will be in the sequence after elements with a tabindex value of 1 or greater.
        </dd>

      <h3> Keyboard Navigation Inside Components</h3>

      <p>
        As described in section <a href="#kbd_generalnav"></a>, the tab sequence should include only one focusable element of a composite UI component.
        Once a composite contains focus, keys other than <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> enable the user to move focus among its focusable elements.
        Authors are free to choose which keys move focus inside of a composite, but they are strongly advised to use the same key bindings as similar components in common GUI operating systems as demonstrated in <a href="#aria_ex"></a>.
      </p>

      <p> The convention for where focus lands in a composite when it receives focus as a result of a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key event depends on the type of composite. It is typically one of the following. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The element that had focus the last time the composite contained focus.
          Or, if the composite has not yet contained the focus, the first element.
          Widgets that usually employ this pattern include grid and tree grid.
        </li>

        <li>
          The selected element. Or, if there is no selected element, the first element.
          Widgets where this pattern is commonly implemented include radio groups, tabs, list boxes, and trees.
          Note: For radio groups, this pattern is referring to the checked radio button; the selected state is not supported for radio buttons.
        </li>

        <li>
          The first element.
          Components that typically follow this pattern include menubars and toolbars.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The following sections explain two strategies for managing focus inside composite elements: creating a roving tabindex and using the aria-activedescendant property.
      </p>

      <section id="kbd_roving_tabindex">
        <h4>Managing Focus Within Components Using a Roving tabindex</h4>

        <p>
          When using roving tabindex to manage focus in a composite UI component, the element that is to be included in the tab sequence has tabindex of "0" and all other focusable elements contained in the composite have tabindex of "-1".
          The algorithm for the roving tabindex strategy is as follows.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>When the component container is loaded or created, set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the element that will initially be included in the tab sequence and set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on all other focusable elements it contains.</li>
          <li>
            When the component contains focus and the user presses a navigation key that moves focus within the component, such as an arrow key:

            <ul>
              <li>set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on the element that has <code>tabindex="0"</code>.</li>
              <li>Set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the element that will become focused as a result of the key event.</li>
              <li>Set focus, <code>element.focus()</code>, on the element that has <code>tabindex="0"</code>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            If the design calls for a specific element to be focused the next time the user moves focus into the composite with <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>, check if that target element has <code>tabindex="0"</code> when the composite loses focus.
            If it does not, set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the target element and set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on the element that previously had <code>tabindex="0"</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One benefit of using roving tabindex rather than aria-activedescendant to manage focus is that the user agent will scroll the newly focused element into view.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="kbd_focus_activedescendant">
        <h4>Managing Focus in Composites Using aria-activedescendant</h4>

        <p>
          If a component container has an ARIA role that supports the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property, it is not necessary to manipulate the tabindex attribute and move DOM focus among focusable elements within the container.
          Instead, only the container element needs to be included in the tab sequence. When the container has DOM focus, the value of aria-activedescendant on the container tells assistive technologies which element is active within the widget.
          Assistive technologies will consider the element referred to as active to be the focused element even though DOM focus is on the element that has the aria-activedescendant property.
          And, when the value of aria-activedescendant is changed, assistive technologies will receive focus change events equivalent to those received when DOM focus actually moves.
        </p>

        <p>The steps for using the aria-activedescendant method of managing focus are as follows.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When the container element that has a role that supports aria-activedescendant is loaded or created, ensure that:
            <ul>
              <li>The container element is included in the tab sequence as described in <a href="#kbd_general_between"></a> or is a focusable element of a composite that implements <a href="#kbd_roving_tabindex">a roving tabindex</a>.</li>
              <li>
                It has <code>aria-activedescendant="IDREF"</code> where IDREF is the ID of the element within the container that should be identified as active when the widget receives focus.
                The referenced element needs to meet the DOM relationship requirements described below.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When the container element receives DOM focus, draw a visual focus indicator on the active element and ensure the active element is scrolled into view.</li>
          <li>When the composite widget contains focus and the user presses a navigation key that moves focus within the widget, such as an arrow key:
            <ul>
              <li>Change the value of aria-activedescendant on the container to refer to the element that should be reported to assistive technologies as active.</li>
              <li>Move the visual focus indicator and, if necessary,  scrolled the active element into view.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the design calls for a specific element to be focused the next time a user moves focus into the composite with <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>, check if aria-activedescendant is referring to that target element when the container loses focus.
            If it is not, set aria-activedescendant to refer to the target element.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The <a href="#aria-activedescendant" class="property-reference">specification for aria-activedescendant</a> places important restrictions on the DOM relationship between the focused element that has the aria-activedescendant attribute and the element referenced as active by the value of the attribute.
          One of the following three conditions must be met.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The element referenced as active is a DOM descendant of the focused referencing element.</li>
          <li>The focused referencing element has a value specified for the <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property that includes the ID of the element referenced as active.</li>
          <li>The focused referencing element has role of <a href="#combobox" class="role-reference">combobox</a>, <a href="#textbox" class="role-reference">textbox</a>, or <a href="#searchbox" class="role-reference">searchbox</a> and has <a href="#aria-controls" class="property-reference">aria-controls</a> property referring to an element with a role that supports aria-activedescendant and either:
            <ol>
              <li>The element referenced as active is a descendant of the controlled element.</li>
              <li>The controlled element has a value specified for the <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property that includes the ID of the element referenced as active.</li>
            </ol>

      <h3>Focusability of disabled controls</h3>
      <p>
        By default, disabled HTML input elements are removed from the tab sequence.
        In most contexts, the normal expectation is that disabled interactive elements are not focusable.
        However, there are some contexts where it is common for disabled elements to be focusable, especially inside of composite widgets.
        For example, as demonstrated in the <a href="#menu"></a> pattern, disabled items are focusable when navigating through a menu with the arrow keys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Removing focusability from disabled elements can offer users both advantages and disadvantages.
        Allowing keyboard users to skip disabled elements usually reduces the number of key presses required to complete a task.
        However, preventing focus from moving to disabled elements can hide their presence from screen reader users who "see" by moving the focus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Authors are encouraged to adopt a consistent set of conventions for the focusability of disabled elements.
        The examples in this guide adopt the following conventions, which both reflect common practice and attempt to balance competing concerns.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>For elements that are in the tab sequence when enabled, remove them from the tab sequence when disabled.</li>

        <li>
          For the following composite widget elements, keep them focusable when disabled:

          <ul>
            <li>Options in a <a href="#Listbox">Listbox</a></li>
            <li>Menu items in a <a href="#menu">Menu or menu bar</a></li>
            <li>Tab elements in a set of <a href="#tabpanel">Tabs</a></li>
            <li>Tree items in a <a href="#TreeView">Tree View</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          For elements contained in a toolbar, make them focusable if discoverability is a concern. Here are two examples to aid with this judgment.

          <ol>
            <li>
              A toolbar with buttons for moving, removing, and adding items in a list includes buttons for &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Add&quot;, and &quot;Remove&quot;.
              The &quot;Up&quot; button is disabled and its focusability is removed when the first item in the list is selected.
              Given the  presence of the &quot;Down&quot; button, discoverability of the &quot;Up&quot; button is not a concern.
            </li>

            <li>
              A toolbar in an editor contains a set of special smart paste functions that are disabled when the clipboard is empty or when the function is not applicable to the current content of the clipboard.
              It could be helpful to keep the disabled buttons focusable if the ability to discover their functionality is primarily via their presence on the toolbar.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>One design technique for mitigating the impact of including disabled elements in the path of keyboard focus is employing appropriate keyboard shortcuts as described in <a href="#kbd_shortcuts"></a>.</p>

        When effectively designed, keyboard shortcuts that focus an element, activate a widget, or both can dramatically enhance usability of frequently used features of a page or site.

        <h4>Designing the Scope and Behavior of Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>

        <p>This section explains the following factors when determining which elements and features to assign keyboard shortcuts and what behavior to give each shortcut:</p>

          <li>Ensuring discovery through navigation; keyboard shortcuts enhance, not replace, standard keyboard access.</li>

              <li>Navigation and activation: Both moving focus to an element and activating it.</li>
            </ol>

          <h5>Ensure Basic Access Via Navigation </h5>

          <p>
            Before assigning keyboard shortcuts, it is essential to ensure the features and functions to which shortcuts may be assigned are keyboard accessible without a keyboard shortcut.
            In other words, all elements that could be targets for keyboard shortcuts need to be focusable via the keyboard using the methods described in:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="#kbd_general_between"></a> </li>

          </ul>

          <p>
            Do not use keyboard shortcuts as a substitute for access via navigation.
            This is essential to full keyboard access because:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>The primary means of making functions and their shortcuts discoverable is by making the target elements focusable and revealing key assignments on the element itself.</li>
            <li>If people who rely on the keyboard have to read documentation to learn which keys are required to use an interface, the interface may technically meet some accessibility standards but in practice is only accessible to the small subset of them who have the knowledge that such documentation exists, have the extra time available, and the ability to retain the necessary information.</li>
            <li>Not all devices that depend on keyboard interfaces can support keyboard shortcuts.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="kbd_shortcuts_design_choose_behavior">
          <h5>Choose Appropriate Shortcut Behavior</h5>

          <p>The following conventions may help identify the most advantageous behavior for a keyboard shortcut.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Move focus when the primary objective is to make navigation more efficient, e.g., reduce the number of times the user must press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or the arrow keys.
              This behavior is commonly expected when assigning a shortcut to a text box, toolbar, or composite, such as a listbox, tree, grid, or menubar.
              This behavior is also useful for moving focus to a section of a page, such as the main content or a complementary landmark section.
            </li>

            <li> Activate an element without moving focus when the target context of the function is the context that contains the focus. This behavior is most common for command buttons and for functions associated with elements that are not visible, such as a "Save" option that is accessible via a menu. For example, if the focus is on an option in a listbox and a toolbar contains buttons for moving and removing options, it is most beneficial to keep focus in the listbox when the user presses a key shortcut for one of the buttons in the toolbar. This behavior can be particularly important for screen reader users because it provides confirmation of the action performed and makes performing multiple commands more efficient. For instance, when a screen reader user presses the shortcut for the "Up" button, the user will be able to hear the new position of the option in the list since it still has the focus. Similarly, when the user presses the shortcut for deleting an option, the user can
                hear the next option in the list and immediately decide whether to press the delete shortcut again. </li>

            <li>
              Move focus and activate when the target of the shortcut has a single function and the context of that function is the same as the target.
              This behavior is typical when a shortcut is assigned to a button that opens a menu or dialog, to a checkbox, or to a navigation link or button.

          <p>The first goal when designing a keyboard interface is simple, efficient, and intuitive operation with only basic keyboard navigation support. If basic operation of a keyboard interface is inefficient, attempting to compensate for fundamental design issues, such as suboptimal layout or command structure, by implementing keyboard shortcuts will not likely reduce user frustration. The practical implication of this is that, in most well-designed user interfaces, the percentage of functionality that needs to be accessible via a keyboard shortcut in order to create optimal usability is not very high. In many simple user interfaces, keyboard shortcuts can be entirely superfluous. And, in user interfaces with too many keyboard shortcuts, the excess shortcuts create cognitive load that make the most useful ones more difficult to remember. </p>

        <h4>Assigning Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
        <p>When choosing the keys to assign to a shortcut, there are many factors to consider.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making the shortcut easy to learn and remember by using a mnemonic (e.g., <kbd>Control + S</kbd> for "Save") or following a logical or spacial pattern.</li>
          <li> Localizing the interface, including for differences in which keys are available and how they behave and for language considerations that could impact mnemonics. </li>

          Methods for designing a key shortcut scheme that supports learning and memory is beyond the scope of this guide.
          Unless the key shortcut scheme is extensive, it is likely sufficient to mimic concepts that are familiar from common desktop software, such as browsers.
          Similarly, while localization is important, describing how to address it is left to other resources that specialize in that topic.

          The remainder of this section provides guidance balancing requirements and concerns related to key assignment conflicts.
          It is typically ideal if key assignments do not conflict with keys that are assigned to functions in the user's operating system, browser, or assistive technology.
          Conflicts can block efficient access to functions that are essential to the user, and a perfect storm of conflicts can trap a user.
          At the same time, there are some circumstances where intentional conflicts are useful.
          And, given the vast array of operating system, browser, and assistive technology keys, it is almost impossible to be certain conflicts do not exist.
          So it is also important to employ strategies that mitigate the impact of conflicts whether they are intentional or unknown.

          <h5>Operating System Key Conflicts</h5>

          <p> It is essential to avoid conflicts with keys that perform system level functions, such as application and window management and display and sound control. In general, this can be achieved by refraining from the following types of assignments. </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Any modifier keys + any of <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd>, or <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</li>

            <li><kbd>Meta</kbd> key + any other single key (there are exceptions, but they can be risky as these keys can change across versions of operating systems). </li>

            <li><kbd>Alt</kbd> + a function key.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            In addition, there are some important application level features that most applications, including browsers, generally support.
            These include:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Zoom</li>
            <li>Copy/Paste</li>

          <h5>Assistive Technology Key Conflicts</h5>

          <p>
            Even though assistive technologies have collectively taken thousands of key assignments, avoiding conflicts is relatively easy.
            This is because assistive technologies have had to develop key assignment schemes that avoid conflicts with both operating systems and applications.
            They do this by hijacking specific keys as modifiers that uniquely define their key commands.
            For example, many assistive technologies use the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key as a modifier.
          </p>

          <p>Deflect assistive technology key conflicts by steering clear of the following types of assignments. </p>

          <ol>
            <li><kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> + any other combination of keys.</li>
            <li><kbd>Insert</kbd> + any combination of other keys.</li>
            <li><kbd>Scroll Lock</kbd> + any combination of other keys.</li>

          <p> While there is considerable similarity among browser keyboard schemes, the patterns within the schemes are less homogenous. Consequently, it is more difficult to avoid conflicts with browser key assignments. While the impact of conflicts is sometimes mitigated by the availability of two paths to nearly every function -- keyboard accessible menus and keyboard shortcuts, avoiding conflicts with shortcuts to heavily used functions is nonetheless important. Pay special attention to avoiding conflicts with shortcuts to: </p>

          <h5>Intentional Key Conflicts</h5>

          <p>
            While avoiding key conflicts is usually desirable, there are circumstances where intentionally conflicting with a browser function is acceptable or even desirable.
            This can occur when the following combination of conditions arises:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>A web application has a frequently used function that is similar to a browser function.</li>

            <li>Users will rarely execute the browser function.</li>
            <li>There is an efficient, alternative path to the browser function.</li>
          </ul>

    <h2>Grid and Table Properties</h2>
    <p>
      To fully present and describe a grid or table, in addition to parsing the headers, rows, and cells using the roles described in the
      <a href="#grid">grid pattern</a> or <a href="#table">table pattern</a>,
      assistive technologies need to be able to determine:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of rows and columns.</li>
      <li>Whether any columns or rows are hidden, e.g., columns 1 through 3 and  5 through 8 are visible but column 4 is hidden.</li>
      <li>Whether a cell spans multiple rows or columns.</li>
      <li>Whether and how data is sorted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Browsers automatically populate their accessibility tree with the number of rows and columns in a grid or table based on the rendered DOM.
      However, there are many situations where the DOM does not contain the whole grid or table, such as when the data set is too large to fully render.
      Additionally, some of this information, like skipped columns or rows and how data is sorted, cannot be derived from the DOM structure.
    </p>
    <p>The below sections explain how to use the following properties that ARIA provides for grid and table accessibility.</p>

      <h3>Using <code>aria-rowcount</code> and <code>aria-rowindex</code></h3>
      <p>
        When the number of rows represented by the DOM structure is not the total number of rows available for a table, grid, or treegrid,
        the  <code>aria-rowcount</code>  property is used to communicate the total number of rows available,
        and it is accompanied by the <code>aria-rowindex</code> property to identify the row indices of the rows that are present in the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>aria-rowcount</code> is specified on the element with the <code>table</code>, <code>grid</code>, or <code>treegrid</code> role.
        Its value is an integer equal to the total number of rows available, including header rows.
        If the total number of rows is unknown, a value of <code>-1</code> may be specified.
        Using a value of <code>-1</code> indicates that more rows are available to include in the DOM without specifying the size of the available supply.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <code>aria-rowcount</code> is used on a <code>table</code>, <code>grid</code>, or <code>treegrid</code>,
        a value for <code>aria-rowindex</code> property is specified on each of its descendant rows, including any header rows.
        The value of <code>aria-rowindex</code> is an integer that is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Greater than or equal to 1.</li>
        <li>Greater than the value of <code>aria-rowindex</code> on any previous rows.</li>
        <li>Set to the index of the first row in the span if cells span multiple rows.</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to the total number of rows.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>WARNING!</strong> Missing or inconsistent values of <code>aria-rowindex</code> could have devastating effects on assistive technology behavior.
        For example, specifying an invalid value for <code>aria-rowindex</code> or setting it on some but not all rows in a table, could cause screen reader table reading functions to skip rows or simply stop functioning.

      <h3>Defining cell spans using <code>aria-colspan</code> and <code>aria-rowspan</code></h3>
      <p>
        For tables, grids, and treegrids  created using elements other than HTML <code>table</code> elements,
        row and column spans are defined with the <code>aria-rowspan</code> and <code>aria-colspan</code> properties.
      </p>
      <p>The value of <code>aria-colspan</code> is an integer that is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Greater than or equal to 1.</li>
        <li>less than the value that would cause the cell to overlap the next cell in the same row.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The value of <code>aria-rowspan</code> is an integer that is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Greater than or equal to 0.</li>
        <li>0 means the cell spans all the remaining rows in its row group.</li>
        <li>less than the value that would cause the cell to overlap the next cell in the same column.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The following example grid has a two row header.
        The first two columns have headers that span both rows of the header.
        The subsequent 6 columns are grouped into 3 pairs with headers in the first row that each span two columns.

        <strong>Note:</strong> When using HTML <code>table</code> elements,

      <h3>Indicating sort order with <code>aria-sort</code></h3>
      <p>
        When rows or columns are sorted, the <code>aria-sort</code> property can be applied to a column or row header to indicate the sorting method.

      <p>
        It is important to note that ARIA does not provide a way to indicate levels of sort for data sets that have multiple sort keys.
        Thus, there is limited value to applying <code>aria-sort</code> with a value other than <code>none</code> to more than one column or row.
      </p>
      <p>The following example grid uses <code>aria-sort</code> to indicate the rows are sorted from the highest "Quiz 2" score to the lowest "Quiz 2" score.</p>

    <h2>Communicating Value and Limits for Range Widgets</h2>
    <p>
      ARIA defines the following roles as range widgets, which means they communicate a value that is typically numeric and constrained to defined limits.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>meter</code></li>
      <li><code>progressbar</code></li>
      <li><code>scrollbar</code></li>
      <li><code>separator</code> (if focusable)</li>
      <li><code>slider</code></li>
      <li><code>spinbutton</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, a spin button for choosing a day within the month of January would allow integer values that range from 1 to 31.
      In some cases, the value is represented numerically, but is not presented as a number to users.
      For instance, a spin button for choosing a day of the week could support values from 1 to 7 but they could be presented to the user as day names, e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section describes considerations for using the following four properties that communicate characteristics of a range widget:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Property</th>
          <th>Definition</th>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuemin</code></th>
          <td>Defines the minimum value allowed by a range widget.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuemax</code></th>
          <td>Defines the maximum value allowed by a range widget.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuenow</code></th>
          <td>Defines the current value of a range widget. This value is a number greater than or equal to <code>aria-valuemin</code> and less than or equal to <code>aria-valuemax</code> (if they are specified).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><code>aria-valuetext</code></th>
          <td>If a numeric value is not sufficiently descriptive, this property can define a text description of the current value of a range widget.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <section id="range_related_properties_using_aria-valuemin_aria-valuemax_and_aria-valuenow">
      <h3>Using <code>aria-valuemin</code>, <code>aria-valuemax</code> and <code>aria-valuenow</code></h3>
      <p>
        When the value of a range widget is constrained to known limits, the <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> properties are used to inform assistive technologies of the minimum and maximum values of the range.
        For some widgets, assistive technologies use this information to present the current value as a percentage.
        When using these properties, set <code>aria-valuemin</code> to the lowest value allowed for the widget and <code>aria-valuemax</code> to the highest allowed value.
        If values for <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code> are not set, default values are exposed to assistive technologies unless the widget is a <code>spinbutton</code>, which is the only range widget that does not have default limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>aria-valuenow</code> property is used to inform assistive technologies of the current value of a range widget.
        Set <code>aria-valuenow</code> to the current value of the widget, ensuring the value of <code>aria-valuenow</code> falls within the range defined by <code>aria-valuemin</code> and <code>aria-valuemax</code>.
        If the current value of a <code>progressbar</code> or <code>spinbutton</code> is indeterminate or unknown, omit the <code>aria-valuenow</code> property.
        The <code>aria-valuenow</code> property is required for the <code>meter</code>, <code>scrollbar</code>, <code>separator</code> (if the element is focusable), and <code>slider</code> roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The range widget roles have the following default values and requirements for <code>aria-valuemin</code>, <code>aria-valuemax</code> and <code>aria-valuenow</code>.

    <h2>Intentionally Hiding Semantics with the <code>presentation</code> Role</h2>
    <p>
      While ARIA is primarily used to express semantics, there are some situations where hiding an
      element’s semantics from assistive technologies is helpful. This is done with the
      <a href="#presentation" class="role-reference">presentation</a>
      role, which declares that an element is being used only for presentation and therefore does
      not have any accessibility semantics. The ARIA 1.1 specification also includes role
      <a href="#none" class="role-reference">none</a>,
      which serves as a synonym for <code>presentation</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider a tabs widget built using an HTML <code>ul</code> element.
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;ul role=&quot;tablist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 1&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 2&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 3&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because the list is declared to be a tablist, the list items are not in a list context. It
      could confuse users if an assistive technology were to render those list items. Applying role
      <code>presentation</code> to the <code>li</code> elements tells browsers to leave those
      elements out of their accessibility tree. Assistive technologies will thus be unaware of the
      list item elements and see the tab elements as immediate children of the tablist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three common uses of role <code>presentation</code> are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hiding a decorative image; it is equivalent to giving the image null alt text. </li>
      <li>Suppressing table semantics of tables used for layout in circumstances where the table semantics do not convey meaningful relationships.</li>
      <li>Eliminating semantics of intervening orphan elements in the structure of a composite
        widget, such as a tablist, menu, or tree as demonstrated in the example above.</li>
    </ol>
    <section id="presentation_role_effects">
      <h3>
        Effects of Role <code>presentation</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        When <code>role=&quot;presentation&quot;</code> is specified on an element, if a
        <a href="#presentation_role_ignored">condition that requires a browser to ignore the <code>presentation</code> role</a>
        does not exist, it has the following three effects.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The element’s implied ARIA role and any ARIA states and properties associated with
          that role are hidden from assistive technologies.</li>
        <li>
          Text contained by the element, i.e., inner text, as well as inner text of all its
          descendant elements remains visible to assistive technologies except, of course, when the
          text is explicitly hidden, e.g., styled with <code>display: none</code> or has <code>aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The roles, states, and properties of each descendant element remain visible to assistive
          technologies unless the descendant requires the context of the presentational
          element. For example:
          <ul>
            <li> If <code>presentation</code> is applied to a <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> element, each child <code>li</code> element inherits the <code>presentation</code> role because ARIA requires the <code>listitem</code> elements to have the parent <code>list</code> element. So, the <code>li</code> elements are not exposed to assistive technologies, but elements contained inside of those <code>li</code> elements, including nested lists, are visible to assistive technologies. </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, if <code>presentation</code> is applied to a <code>table</code> element,
              the descendant <code>caption</code>, <code>thead</code>, <code>tbody</code>, <code>tfoot</code>,
              <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code>, and <code>td</code>
              elements inherit role <code>presentation</code> and are thus not exposed to assistive technologies.
              But, elements inside of the <code>th</code> and <code>td</code> elements, including nested tables,  are exposed to assistive technologies.

    <h2>Roles That Automatically Hide Semantics by Making Their Descendants Presentational</h2>
    <p>
      There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform
      accessibility API, can only contain text. For example, accessibility APIs do not have a way of
      representing semantic elements contained in a button. To deal with this limitation, WAI-ARIA
      requires browsers to automatically apply role <code>presentation</code> to all descendant
      elements of any element with a role that cannot support semantic children.
    </p>
    <p>The roles that require all children to be presentational are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>button</li>
      <li>checkbox</li>
      <li>img</li>
      <li>meter</li>
      <li>menuitemcheckbox</li>
      <li>menuitemradio</li>
      <li>option</li>
      <li>progressbar</li>
      <li>radio</li>
      <li>scrollbar</li>
      <li>separator</li>
      <li>slider</li>
      <li>switch</li>
      <li>tab</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For instance, consider the following tab element, which contains a heading.</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because WAI-ARIA requires descendants of tab to be presentational,
      the following code is equivalent.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      And, from the perspective of anyone using a technology that relies on an accessibility API, such as a screen reader,
      the heading does not exist since the previous code is equivalent to the following.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/li&gt;

  <section id="structural_roles">
    <h2>Structural Roles</h2>
    <p>
      ARIA provides a set of roles that convey the accessibility semantics of structures on a page.
      These roles express the meaning that is conveyed by the layout and appearance of elements that organize and structure content, such as headings, lists, and tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      some host languages, such as HTML, include elements that express the same semantics as an ARIA role.
      For instance, the HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is mapped to accessibility APIs in exactly the same way as <code>&lt;div role="paragraph"&gt;</code>.
      The ARIA and HTML specifications refer to this mapping of HTML elements to ARIA attributes as implied semantics, i.e., the implied ARIA role of the HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is <code>paragraph</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When developing HTML, it is important to use native HTML elements where ever possible.
      Do not use an ARIA role or property if it is possible to use an HTML element that has equivalent semantics.
      Circumstances where it is appropriate to use ARIA attributes instead of equivalent HTML are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>When the HTML element cannot be styled in a way that meets visual design requirements.</li>
      <li>When testing reveals that browsers or assistive technologies provide better support for the ARIA equivalent.</li>
      <li>When remediating or retrofitting legacy content and altering the underlying DOM to use the HTML would be cost prohibitive.</li>
      <li>When building a web component to compose a <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#custom-elements">custom element</a> and the element being extended  does not convey the appropriate or sufficient accessibility semantics.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Change History</h2>
    
    <p>
      APG 1.1 supported ARIA 1.1, and this version, APG 1.2, includes changes to support version 1.2 of the ARIA specification.
      It also includes nearly 200 significant updates to improve the quality and breadth of content.
      A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Change-Log-for-November-2021-APG-1.2-Note-Release-1">detailed log of all changes</a> is available on the wiki of the w3c/aria-practices GitHub repository.
      Highlights of major changes to support ARIA 1.2 as well as some of the improvements include the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added section to provide guidance related to 38 document structure roles, 18 of which are new in ARIA 1.2.</li>
      <li>Revised guidance for roles where naming requirements changed in ARIA 1.2. ARIA 1.2 prohibits names on some roles. ARIA 1.2 removed naming requirements from some other roles.</li>
      <li>Added naming guidance for 18 roles that are new in ARIA 1.2.</li>
      <li>Revised the combobox pattern and 4 combobox examples to reflect the ARIA 1.2 revisions to combobox.</li>
      <li>Added example illustrating changes in ARIA 1.2 that enable creation of custom select-only comboboxes, which are similar to HTML select elements. This replaces the Collapsible Listbox example, which is now deprecated.</li>
      <li>Revised the listbox pattern to specify how to utilize the new ARIA 1.2 support for named groups of options and Added a new listbox example to demonstrate the named option group feature.</li>
      <li>Revised the editor menubar example to illustrate new ARIA 1.2 support for named groups of items in a menu.</li>
      <li>Updated the listbox and tree patterns to reflect current browser processing of aria-selected and provided guidance regarding the use of aria-checked to communicate selection.</li>
      <li>Added section providing guidance about properties used with range widgets, such as aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax.</li>
      <li>Added a design pattern and example implementation of the meter role, which is new in ARIA 1.2</li>
      <li>Added two examples that demonstrate how to create rating inputs, one based on slider and one based on radio group.</li>
      <li>Added two other slider examples: a vertical temperature slider and a media seek slider.</li>
      <li>Added a switch design pattern and three example implementations: one made from a div element, one based on HTML button, and one that uses HTML checkbox input.</li>
      <li>Added a button example that illustrates use of the new ARIA 1.2 IDL interface.</li>
      <li>Added a date picker example that illustrates choosing a date with a combobox.</li>
      <li>Added another example of a disclosure navigation menu that demonstrates how to include top-level links.</li>
      <li>Added example of a sortable table.</li>
      <li>Changed all example pages to include a <q>Jump to</q> menu, a button to  open the example in CodePen, and added a prominently placed warning with guidance about testing before re-using example code.</li>
      <li>Improved support for high contrast settings and added detailed documentation of high contrast support in many examples.</li>
      <li>Improved support for touch-based screen readers in several examples, most notably in sliders.</li>
      <li>Due to change in ARIA 1.2, removed Math role from list of roles that have presentational children.</li>
      <li>Developed a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Code-Guide#apg-coding-standards">comprehensive set of coding standards for HTML, CSS, and Javascript</a> for the APG and updated a significant portion of content to conform with the standards.</li>
      <li>In response to feedback, fixed many documentation errors and functional bugs in examples.</li>
    </ul>
