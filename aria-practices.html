      This document provides readers with an understanding of how to use <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.2</a></cite> [[WAI-ARIA]] to create accessible rich internet applications.
      It describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties.
      This document is directed primarily to Web application developers, but the guidance is also useful for user agent and assistive technology developers.
    </p>
    <p>This document is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>.</p>

      This is an editor's draft by the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group</a>
      of the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>.
      It supports the
      [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] [[WAI-ARIA-1.2]]
      specification, providing detailed advice and examples beyond what would be appropriate to a technical specification but which are important to understand the specification.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This section is <em>informative.</em></p>
    <p>
      WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices is a guide for understanding how to use
      <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/">WAI-ARIA 1.2</a></cite> to create an accessible Rich Internet Application.
      It provides guidance on the appropriate application of WAI-ARIA, describes recommended WAI-ARIA usage patterns, and explains concepts behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Languages used to create rich and dynamic web sites, e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SVG, do not natively include all the features required to make sites usable by people who use assistive technologies (AT) or who rely on keyboard navigation.
      The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications working group (ARIA WG) is addressing these deficiencies through several W3C standards efforts.
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>
      provides additional background on WAI-ARIA, summarizes those efforts, and lists the other documents included in the WAI-ARIA suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief <q>Read Me First</q> section, the guide begins with ARIA implementation patterns for common widgets that both enumerate expected behaviors and demonstrate those behaviors with working code.
      The implementation patterns and examples refer to detailed explanations of supporting concepts in subsequent guidance sections.
      The guidance sections cover more general topics such as use of ARIA landmarks, practices for keyboard interfaces, grid and table properties, and the effects of role <code>presentation</code>.
