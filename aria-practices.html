    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) explains how to create accessible web experiences for users of assistive technologies and keyboard interfaces by developing web sites that properly convey accessibility semantics and implement common keyboard conventions.
      It also provides guidance on some closely related topics, such as supporting operating system settings for high contrast and reduced motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accessibility semantics refer to the meaning of user interface elements that need to be conveyed to assistive technology users in order for those users to understand and use the elements.
      For example, people who can visually perceive a search icon button understand the element can be activated to perform a search by the way it is styled and positioned.
      To make that icon accessible to a screen reader user, one of the semantics that needs to be communicated is that the element represents an interactive button.
      In addition, keyboard accessibility requires the button to be focusable, and keyboard conventions call for pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to activate the button when it is focused.
      The APG describes how to convey accessibility semantics and implement keyboard accessibility for many common design patterns, ranging from typical buttons and popup menus to complex tree grids.
      It also explains essential practices related to these patterns, such as how to convey web page structure with ARIA landmark regions and effectively utilize the many ways of encoding accessible names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The APG is organized into two major sections: patterns and practices.
      Each pattern explains how to make a common user interface element, such as a button, menu, or dialog, accessible, and provides functional example implementations of the pattern.
      The practices section gives in-depth explanation of how to satisfy a variety of accessibility needs that surface when making rich internet application experiences accessible.
      For instance, the practices section on providing accessible names and descriptions gives detailed descriptions of seven different naming techniques as well as a table providing guidance for naming more than 80 types of elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The APG assumes basic understanding of web development, especially of HTML and CSS.
      It may be particularly useful to designers and engineers who are working on site design systems and component libraries.
      However, it is important to understand that the APG only covers a portion of what is needed to create accessible experiences.
      To understand accessibility more broadly, it is advisable to start with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">WAI Accessibility Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/design-develop/">WAI Overview of Design and Development</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accessibility semantics used in the APG patterns and described in APG practices are defined in the
      <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/">WAI-ARIA 1.2 Specification</a></cite>.
      That is, the ARIA specification standardizes the meaning of the attributes that describe elements and their states to assistive technologies, such as the meaning of <code>role="button"</code>.
      These attributes and other features required to make sites usable by people who rely on assistive technologies or keyboard navigation are not natively included in the languages used to create web sites, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SVG.
      The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications working group (ARIA WG) is addressing these deficiencies through several W3C standards efforts.
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>
      provides additional background on WAI-ARIA, summarizes those efforts, and lists the other documents included in the WAI-ARIA suite.

    <h2>Read Me First</h2>
    <section id="no_aria_better_bad_aria">
      <h3>No ARIA is better than Bad ARIA</h3>
      <p>
        Functionally, ARIA roles, states, and properties are analogous to a CSS for assistive technologies.
        For screen reader users, ARIA controls the rendering of their non-visual experience.
        Incorrect ARIA misrepresents visual experiences, with potentially devastating effects on their corresponding non-visual experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Before using ARIA or any of the guidance in this document, please take time to understand the following two essential principles.</p>
      <h4>Principle 1: A role is a promise</h4>
      <p>This code:</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div role=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Place Order&lt;/div&gt;
          </code> </pre>
      <p>
        Is a promise that the author of that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has also incorporated JavaScript that provides the keyboard interactions expected for a button.
        Unlike HTML input elements, ARIA roles do not cause browsers to provide keyboard behaviors or styling.
      </p>
      <p>Using a role without fulfilling the promise of that role is similar to making a &quot;Place Order&quot; button that abandons an order and empties the shopping cart.</p>
      <p>One of the objectives of this guide is to define expected behaviors for each ARIA role.</p>
      <h4>Principle 2: ARIA Can Both Cloak and Enhance, Creating Both Power and Danger</h4>
      <p>
        The information assistive technologies need about the meaning and purpose of user interface elements is called accessibility semantics.
        From the perspective of assistive technologies, ARIA gives authors the ability to dress up HTML and SVG elements with critical accessibility semantics that the assistive technologies would not otherwise be able to reliably derive.
      </p>
      <p>Some of ARIA is like a cloak; it covers up, or overrides, the original semantics or content.</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;a role=&quot;menuitem&quot;&gt;Assistive tech users perceive this element as an item in a menu, not a link.&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a aria-label=&quot;Assistive tech users can only perceive the contents of this aria-label, not the link text&quot;&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>On the other hand, some uses of ARIA are more like suspenders or belts; they add meaning that provides essential support to the original content.</p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;button aria-pressed=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Mute&lt;/button&gt;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This is the power of ARIA.
        It enables authors to describe nearly any user interface component in ways that assistive technologies can reliably interpret, thus making components accessible to assistive technology users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also the danger of ARIA.
        Authors can inadvertently override accessibility semantics.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;table role=&quot;log&quot;&gt;
            &lt;!--
              Table that assistive technology users will not perceive as a table.
              The log role tells browser this is a log, not a table.
            --&gt;
          &lt;/table&gt;
          &lt;ul role=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
            &lt;!-- This is a navigation region, not a list. --&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;uri1&quot;&gt;nav link 1&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;uri2&quot;&gt;nav link 2&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;!-- ERROR! Previous list items are not in a list! --&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Browser and Assistive Technology Support</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Testing assistive technology interoperability is essential before using code from this guide in production.</strong>
        Because the purpose of this guide is to illustrate appropriate use of ARIA 1.2 as defined in the ARIA specification, the design patterns, reference examples, and sample code intentionally <strong>do not</strong> describe and implement coding techniques for working around problems caused by gaps in support for ARIA 1.2 in browsers and assistive technologies.
        It is thus advisable to test implementations thoroughly with each browser and assistive technology combination that is relevant within a target audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, JavaScript and CSS in this guide is written to be compatible with the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari at the time of writing.
Some JavaScript and CSS may not function correctly in Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except in cases where the ARIA Working Group and other contributors have overlooked an error,
        examples in this guide that do not function well in a particular browser or with a specific assistive technology are demonstrating browser or assistive technology bugs.
        Browser and assistive technology developers can thus utilize code in this guide to help assess the quality of their support for ARIA 1.2.
      </p>

    <section id="mobile_and_touch_support">
      <h3>Mobile and Touch Support</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, this guide does not indicate which examples are compatible with mobile browsers or touch interfaces.
        While some of the examples include specific features that enhance mobile and touch support, some ARIA features are not supported in any mobile browser.
        In addition, there is not yet a standardized approach for providing touch interactions that work across mobile browsers.
      </p>
      <p>More guidance about touch and mobile support is planned for future releases of the guide.</p>

    <h2>Change History</h2>
    
    <p>
      APG 1.1 supported ARIA 1.1, and this version, APG 1.2, includes changes to support version 1.2 of the ARIA specification.
      It also includes nearly 200 significant updates to improve the quality and breadth of content.
      A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Change-Log-for-November-2021-APG-1.2-Note-Release-1">detailed log of all changes</a> is available on the wiki of the w3c/aria-practices GitHub repository.
      Highlights of major changes to support ARIA 1.2 as well as some of the improvements include the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added section to provide guidance related to 38 document structure roles, 18 of which are new in ARIA 1.2.</li>
      <li>Revised guidance for roles where naming requirements changed in ARIA 1.2. ARIA 1.2 prohibits names on some roles. ARIA 1.2 removed naming requirements from some other roles.</li>

      <li>Revised the combobox pattern and 4 combobox examples to reflect the ARIA 1.2 revisions to combobox.</li>
      <li>Added example illustrating changes in ARIA 1.2 that enable creation of custom select-only comboboxes, which are similar to HTML select elements. This replaces the Collapsible Listbox example, which is now deprecated.</li>
      <li>Revised the listbox pattern to specify how to utilize the new ARIA 1.2 support for named groups of options and Added a new listbox example to demonstrate the named option group feature.</li>
      <li>Revised the editor menubar example to illustrate new ARIA 1.2 support for named groups of items in a menu.</li>
      <li>Updated the listbox and tree patterns to reflect current browser processing of aria-selected and provided guidance regarding the use of aria-checked to communicate selection.</li>
      <li>Added section providing guidance about properties used with range widgets, such as aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax.</li>
      <li>Added a design pattern and example implementation of the meter role, which is new in ARIA 1.2</li>

      <li>Added example of a sortable table.</li>
      <li>Changed all example pages to include a <q>Jump to</q> menu, a button to  open the example in CodePen, and added a prominently placed warning with guidance about testing before re-using example code.</li>
      <li>Improved support for high contrast settings and added detailed documentation of high contrast support in many examples.</li>
      <li>Improved support for touch-based screen readers in several examples, most notably in sliders.</li>
      <li>Due to change in ARIA 1.2, removed Math role from list of roles that have presentational children.</li>
      <li>Developed a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Code-Guide#apg-coding-standards">comprehensive set of coding standards for HTML, CSS, and Javascript</a> for the APG and updated a significant portion of content to conform with the standards.</li>
