    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This section is <em>informative.</em></p>

    <p>
      WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices is a guide to understanding how to use WAI-ARIA to create an accessible Rich Internet Application.
      It describes recommended WAI-ARIA usage patterns and provides an introduction to the concepts behind them.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide is one part of a suite of resources that support the WAI-ARIA specification.
      The WAI-ARIA suite fills accessibility gaps identified by the [[WAI-ARIA-ROADMAP]].
    </p>

    <p>
      As explained in <a href="#ariaBackground">Background on WAI-ARIA</a>, languages used to create rich and dynamic web sites, e.g., HTML, Javascript, CSS, and SVG, do not natively include all the features required to make sites usable by people who use assistive technologies (AT) or who rely on keyboard navigation.
      The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications working group (ARIA WG) is addressing these deficiencies through several W3C standards efforts, with a focus on the WAI-ARIA specifications.
      For an introduction to WAI-ARIA, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA) Overview</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the understanding many prefer to learn from examples, the guide begins with a section that demonstrates how to make common widgets accessible with descriptions of expected behaviors supported by working code.
      Where it is helpful to do so, the examples refer to detailed explanations of supporting concepts in subsequent sections.
      The sections that follow the examples first provide background that helps build understanding of how WAI-ARIA works and how it fits into the larger web technology picture.
      Next, the guide covers general steps for building an accessible widget using WAI-ARIA, JavaScript, and CSS, including detailed guidance on how to make rich internet applications keyboard accessible.
      The scope then widens to include the full application, addressing the page layout and structural semantics critical to enabling a usable experience with assistive technologies on pages containing both rich applications and rich documents.
      It includes guidance on dynamic document management, use of WAI-ARIA Form properties, and the creation of WAI-ARIA-enabled alerts and dialogs.

    <h2>Design Patterns and Widgets</h2>
    <p>This section demonstrates how to make common rich internet application widgets and patterns accessible by applying WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties and implementing keyboard support.</p>
    <p class="note">
      Although users of Mac OS X are familiar with using the <kbd>Command</kbd> key instead of the <kbd>Control</kbd> key, the <kbd>Command</kbd> key is typically reserved for desktop applications and OS-level integration.
      Until device and platform independence can be addressed in WAI-ARIA 2.0, the primary <kbd>Control</kbd> modifier key for WAI-ARIA widget interaction is specified as <kbd>Control</kbd> on all platforms, including Mac OS X.
    </p>

    <section id="aria_ex_widget">
      <h3>Generally Applicable Keyboard Recommendations </h3>
      <p>The following keyboard conventions are applicable to many of the patterns described in subsequent sections.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><kbd>Shift + F10</kbd> opens associated context menu</li>
        <li><kbd>Control + C</kbd> Copies to clipboard </li>
        <li><kbd>Control + V</kbd> Pastes from clipboard </li>
        <li><kbd>Control + X</kbd> Copies to clipboard and cuts </li>
        <li><kbd>Control + Z</kbd> undo last action</li>
        <li><kbd>Control + Y</kbd> Redo action</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="widget" id="accordion">
      <h3>Accordion (Sections With Show/Hide Functionality)</h3>
      <p>
        An accordion is a vertically stacked set of elements, such as labels or thumbnails, that allow the user to toggle the display of sections of content.
        Each labeling element can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide its associated content.
        Accordions are commonly used to reduce the need to scroll when presenting multiple sections of content on a single page.
      </p>
      <p>Terms for understanding accordions include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Accordion Header:</dt>
        <dd>Label for or thumbnail representing a section of content that also serves as a control for showing, and in some implementations, hiding  the section of content. </dd>
        <dt>Accordion Panel:</dt>
        <dd>Section of content associated with an accordion header.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        In some accordions, there are additional elements that are always visible adjacent to the accordion header.
        For instance, a menubutton may accompany each accordion header to provide access to actions that apply to that section.
        And, in some cases, a snippet of the hidden content may also be visually persistent.
      </p>
      <section class="notoc">
        <h4>Keyboard Interaction</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd>:
            <ul>
              <li>
                When focus is on the accordion header for a collapsed panel, expands the associated panel.
                If the implementation allows only one panel to be expanded, and if another panel is expanded, collapses that panel.
              </li>
              <li>
                When focus is on the accordion header for an expanded panel, collapses the panel if the implementation supports collapsing.
                Some implementations require one panel to be expanded at all times and allow only one panel to be expanded; so, they do not support a collapse function.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> (Optional): If focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the next accordion header.
            If focus is on the last accordion header, either does nothing or moves focus to the first accordion header.
          </li>
          <li>
            <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> (Optional): If focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the previous accordion header.
            If focus is on the first accordion header, either does nothing or moves focus to the last accordion header.

          <li>
            <kbd>End</kbd> (Optional): When focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the last accordion header.
          </li>
          <li>
            <kbd>Control + Page Down</kbd> (Optional): If focus is inside an accordion
            panel or on an accordion header, moves focus to the next accordion header.
            If focus is in the last accordion header or panel, either does nothing or
            moves focus to the first accordion header.
          </li>
          <li>
            <kbd>Control + Page Up</kbd> (Optional): If focus is inside an accordion panel, moves focus to the header for that panel.
            If focus is on an accordion header, moves focus to the previous accordion header.
            If focus is on the first accordion header, either does nothing or moves focus to the last accordion header.

        <h4>WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The title of each accordion header is contained in an element with role <a href="#button" class="role-reference">button</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each accordion header <code>button</code> is wrapped in an element with role <a href="#heading" class="role-reference">heading</a> that has a value set for <a href="#aria-level" class="property-reference">aria-level</a> that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.
            <ul>
              <li>If the native host language has an element with an implicit <code>heading</code> and <code>aria-level</code>, such as an HTML heading tag, a native host language element may be used.</li>
              <li>
                The <code>button</code> element is the only element inside the <code>heading</code> element.
                That is, if there are other visually persistent elements, they are not included inside the <code>heading</code> element.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the accordion panel associated with an accordion header is visible, the header <code>button</code> element has <a href="#aria-expanded" class="state-reference">aria-expanded</a> set to <code>true</code>.
            If the panel is not visible, <a href="#aria-expanded" class="state-reference">aria-expanded</a> is set to <code>false</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The accordion header <code>button</code> element has <a href="#aria-controls" class="property-reference">aria-controls</a> set to the ID of the element containing the accordion panel content.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the accordion panel associated with an accordion header is visible, and if the accordion does not permit the panel to be collapsed, the header <code>button</code> element has <a href="#aria-disabled" class="state-reference">aria-disabled</a> set to <code>true</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optionally, each element that serves as a container for panel content has role
            <a href="#region" class="role-reference">region</a> and
            <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference">aria-labelledby</a>
            with a value that refers to the button that controls display of the panel.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Avoid using the <code>region</code> role in circumstances that create landmark region proliferation,
                e.g., in an accordion that contains more than approximately 6 panels that can be expanded at the same time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Role <code>region</code> is especially helpful to the perception of structure by screen reader users when panels contain heading elements or a nested accordion.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

    <section class="widget" id="alert">
      <h3>Alert</h3>
      <p>
        An <a class="role-reference" href="#alert">alert</a> is an element that displays a brief, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task.
        Dynamically rendered alerts are automatically announced by most screen readers, and in some operating systems, they may trigger an alert sound.
        It is important to note that, at this time, screen readers do not inform users of alerts that are present on the page before page load completes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because alerts are intended to provide important and potentially time-sensitive information without interfering with the user's ability to continue working,
        it is crucial they do not affect keyboard focus.
        The <a href="#alertdialog">alert dialog</a> is designed for situations where interrupting work flow is necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also important to avoid designing alerts that disappear automatically.
        An alert that disappears too quickly can lead to failure to meet
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-no-exceptions.html">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.3</a>.
        Another critical design consideration is the frequency of interruption caused by alerts.
        Frequent interruptions inhibit usability for people with visual and cognitive disabilities, which makes meeting the requirements of
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-postponed.html">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.4</a>

      <h3>Alert and Message Dialogs</h3>
      <p>
        An alert dialog  is a <a href="#dialog_modal">modal dialog</a> that interrupts the user's workflow to communicate an important message and acquire a response.
        Examples include action confirmation prompts and error message confirmations.
        The <a href="#alertdialog" class="role-reference">alertdialog</a> role
        enables assistive technologies and browsers to distinguish alert dialogs from other dialogs
        so they have the option of giving alert dialogs special treatment, such as playing a system alert sound.

    <section class="widget" id="button">
      <h3>Button</h3>
      <p>
        A <a class="role-reference" href="#button">button</a> is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, canceling an action, or performing a delete operation.
        A common convention for informing users that a button launches a dialog is to append &quot;&#8230;&quot; (ellipsis) to the button label, e.g., &quot;Save as&#8230;&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the ordinary button widget, WAI-ARIA supports 2 other types of buttons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Toggle button: A two-state button that can be either off (not pressed) or on (pressed).
          To tell assistive technologies that a button is a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute <a href="#aria-pressed" class="state-reference">aria-pressed</a>.
          For example, a button labeled mute in an audio player could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true.
          <strong>Important:</strong> it is critical the label on a toggle does not change when its state changes.
          In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label remains &quot;Mute&quot; so a screen reader would say something like &quot;Mute toggle button pressed&quot;.
          Alternatively, if the design were to call for the button label to change from &quot;Mute&quot; to &quot;Unmute,&quot; the aria-pressed attribute would not be needed.

        <li>Menu button: as described in the <a href="#menubutton">menu button pattern</a>, a button is revealed to assistive technologies as a menu button if it has the property <a href="#aria-haspopup" class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</a> set to <code>true</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        The types of actions performed by buttons are distinctly different from the function of a link (see <a href="#link">link pattern</a>).
        It is important that both the appearance and role of a widget match the function it provides.
        Nevertheless, elements occasionally have the visual style of a link but perform the action of a button.
        In such cases, giving the element role <code>button</code> helps assistive technology users understand the function of the element.
        However, a better solution is to adjust the visual design so it matches the function and ARIA role.

        <h4>Keyboard Interaction</h4>
        <p>When the button has focus:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <kbd>Space</kbd>: Activates the button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Activates the button.
          </li>
          <li>
            Following button activation, focus is set depending on the type of action the button
            performs. For example:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If activating the button opens a dialog, the focus moves inside the dialog. (see
                <a href="#dialog_modal">dialog pattern</a>)
              </li>
              <li>If activating the button closes a dialog, focus typically returns to the
                button that opened the dialog unless the function performed in the dialog context
                logically leads to a different element. For example, activating a cancel button in a
                dialog returns focus to the button that opened the dialog. However, if
                the dialog were confirming the action of deleting the page from which it was
                opened, the focus would logically move to a new context.</li>
              <li>If activating the button does not dismiss the current context, then focus
                typically remains on the button after activation, e.g., an Apply or
                Recalculate button.</li>
              <li>If the button action indicates a context change, such as move to next step in
                a wizard or add another search criteria, then it is often appropriate to move focus to
                the starting point for that action.</li>
              <li>
                If the button is activated with a shortcut key, the focus usually remains in
                the context from which the shortcut key was activated. For example, if <kbd>Alt
                  + U</kbd> were assigned to an &quot;Up&quot; button that moves the currently focused
                item in a list one position higher in the list, pressing <kbd>Alt + U</kbd> when the
                focus is in the list would not move the focus from the list.

      <h3>Checkbox</h3>
      <p>WAI-ARIA supports two types of <a href="#checkbox" class="role-reference">checkbox</a> widgets:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dual-state: The most common type of checkbox, it allows the user to toggle between two choices -- checked and not checked.</li>
        <li>Tri-state: This type of checkbox supports an additional third state known as partially checked.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        One common use of a tri-state checkbox can be found in software installers where a single tri-state checkbox is used to represent and control the state of an entire group of install options.
        And, each option in the group can be individually turned on or off with a dual state checkbox.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If all options in the group are checked, the overall state is represented by the tri-state checkbox displaying as checked.</li>
        <li>If some of the options in the group are checked, the overall state is represented with the tri-state checkbox displaying as partially checked.</li>
        <li>If none of the options in the group are checked, the overall state of the group is represented with the tri-state checkbox displaying as not checked.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The user can use the tri-state checkbox to change all options in the group with a single action:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Checking the overall checkbox checks all options in the group.</li>
        <li>Unchecking the overall checkbox will uncheck all options in the group.</li>
        <li>
          And, In some implementations, the system may remember which options were checked the last time the overall status was partially checked.
          If this feature is provided, activating the overall checkbox a third time recreates that partially checked state where only some options in the group are checked.

      <h3>Dialog (Modal)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> This section has been significantly revised to address initial focus placement and other outstanding editorial issues. 
        Please provide feedback on this design pattern in 
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/325">issue 325.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="#dialog" class="role-reference">dialog</a> is a window overlayed on either the primary window or another dialog window.
        The window under a modal dialog is typically inert; users cannot interact with content outside the dialog window.
        If the background window is not inert, then interaction with elements in the background window cause the modal window to close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like <a href="#dialog_nonmodal">non-modal dialogs</a>, modal dialogs contain their tab sequence.
        That is, <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> do not move focus outside the dialog.
        However, unlike most non-modal dialogs, modal dialogs do not provide means for moving keyboard focus outside the dialog window without closing the dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="#alertdialog" class="role-reference">alertdialog</a> role is a special-case dialog role
        designed specifically for dialogs that divert users' attention to a brief, important message.
        Its usage is described in the <a href="#alertdialog">alert dialog design pattern.</a>

              <li>Unless a condition where doing otherwise is advisable, focus is initially set on the first focusable element.</li>
              <li>
                If content is large enough that focusing the first interactive element could cause the beginning of content to scroll out of view, 
                it is advisable to add <code>tabindex=<q>-1</q></code> to a static element at the top of the dialog, such as the dialog title or first paragraph, and initially focus that element.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a dialog contains the final step in a process that is not easily reversible, such as deleting data or completing a financial transaction, 
                it may be advisable to set focus on the least destructive action, especially if undoing the action is difficult or impossible.
                The <a href="#alertdialog">Alert Dialog Pattern</a> is often employed in such circumstances.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a dialog is limited to interactions that either provide additional information or continue processing,

            When a dialog closes, focus typically returns to the element that had focus before the dialog was invoked.
            This is often the control that opened the dialog.
            In circumstances where that element no longer exists, focus is set on an element that supports a logical work flow.

    <section class="widget" id="feed">
      <h3 class="widget-name">Feed</h3>
      <p class="note">
        This section contains an early draft of new content.
        Feedback is welcom in
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/245">issue 245.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A feed is a section of a page that automatically loads new content as the user reads.
        Content in a feed is segmented into article elements. Thus, it can be thought of as a dynamic list of articles
        that often appears to scroll infinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary difference between a feed and other ARIA patterns that support loading data as users scroll,
        e.g., a <a href="#grid">grid</a>, is that a feed is a structure, not a widget. This means assistive
        technologies with a reading mode, such as screen readers, will default to reading mode when
        interacting with feed content, making the feed pattern most useful for blocks of
        unstructured information that may contain links or other interactive elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a product page on a shopping site may have a related products section that
        displays five products at a time. As the user scrolls,  more products are requested  and loaded into the DOM.
         While a static design might include a next button for loading five more products, a dynamic implementation
        that automatically loads data as needed simplifies the user
        experience and reduces the inertia associated with viewing more than the first five product suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, when web pages load content dynamically based on scroll events, it
        creates interoperability difficulties for users of assistive technologies that cannot
        sufficiently mimic visual scrolling.
        Even if the page also observes focus movements in
        order to identify when more content is needed,
        there can still be problems because requiring assistive technologies to
        move DOM focus in response to every reading cursor movement, regardless of context,
        can also negatively impact a screen reading experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feed pattern enables reliable assistive technology reading mode interaction by
        establishing the following interoperability agreement between the web page and assistive
        technologies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the context of a feed, the web page code is responsible for:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Appropriate visual scrolling of the content based on which article contains DOM focus.
          </li>
          <li>Loading or removing feed articles based on which article contains DOM focus.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
        <li>In the context of a feed, assistive technologies with a reading mode are responsible for:
          <ul>
            <li>Indicating which article contains the reading cursor by ensuring the article element or one of its descendants has DOM focus.</li>
            <li>providing reading mode keys that move DOM focus to the next and previous articles.</li>
            <li>Providing reading mode keys for moving the reading cursor and DOM focus past the end and before the start of the feed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Thus, implementing the feed pattern allows a screen reader to reliably read and trigger the loading
        of feed content while staying in its reading mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another feature of the feed pattern is its ability to facilitate skim reading for
        assistive technology users. Web page authors may provide both an accessible name and
        description for each article. By identifying the elements inside of an
        article that provide the title and the primary content, assistive technologies can provide
        functions that enable users to jump from article to article and efficiently discern which
        articles may be worthy of more attention.
      </p>
      <section class="notoc">
        <h4>Keyboard Interaction</h4>
        <p>
          The feed pattern is not based on a desktop GUI widget so the <code>feed</code> role is not associated with any well-established keyboard conventions.
          Supporting the following, or a similar,  interface is recommended.
        </p>
        <p>When focus is inside the feed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><kbd>Page Down</kbd>: Move focus to next article.</li>
          <li><kbd>Page Up</kbd>: Move focus to previous article.</li>
          <li><kbd>Control + End</kbd>: Move focus to the first focusable element after the feed.</li>
          <li><kbd>Control + Home</kbd>: Move focus to the first focusable element before the feed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol class="note">
          <li>Due to the lack of convention, providing easily discoverable keyboard interface documentation is especially important.</li>

            In some cases, a feed may contain a nested feed.
            For example, an article in a social media feed may contain a feed of comments on that article.
            To navigate the nested feed, users first move focus inside the nested feed.
            Options for supporting nested feed navigation include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users move focus into the nested feed from the content of the containing article with <kbd>Tab</kbd>. 
                This may be slow if the article contains a significant number of links, buttons, or other widgets.
               </li>
              <li>Provide a key for moving focus from the elements in the containing article to the first item in the nested feed, e.g., <kbd>Alt + Page Down</kbd>.</li>
              <li>To continue reading the outer feed, <kbd>Control + End</kbd> moves focus to the next article in the outer feed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In the rare circumstance that a feed article contains a widget that uses the above suggested keys, the feed navigation key will operate the contained widget, and the user needs to move focus to an element that does not utilize the feed navigation keys in order to navigate the feed.</li>

      <h3>Grids : Interactive Tabular Data and Layout Containers</h3>

      <p>
        A <a href="#grid" class="role-reference">grid</a> widget is a container that enables users to navigate the information or interactive elements it contains using directional navigation keys, such as arrow keys, <kbd>Home</kbd> , and <kbd>End</kbd>.
        As a generic container widget that offers flexible keyboard navigation, it can serve a wide variety of needs.
        It can be used for purposes as simple as grouping a collection of checkboxes or navigation links or as complex as creating a full-featured spreadsheet application.
        While ARIA properties and assistive technologies use row and column nomenclature when describing and presenting the logical structure of elements with the <code>grid</code> role, using the <code>grid</code> role on an element does not necessarily imply that its visual presentation is tabular.
      </p>

      <p>When presenting content that is tabular, consider the following factors when choosing between implementing this <code>grid</code> patern or the <a href="#table">table</a> pattern.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A <code>grid</code> is a composite widget so it:

          <ul>
            <li>Always contains multiple focusable elements. </li>
            <li>Has only one focusable element in the page tab sequence.</li>
            <li>Requires the author to provide code that <a href="#kbd_general_within">manages focus movement inside it</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>All focusable elements contained in a table are included in the page tab sequence. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Uses of the <code>grid</code> pattern broadly fall into two categories: presenting tabular information (data grids) and grouping other widgets (layout grids).
        Even though both data grids and layout grids employ the same ARIA roles, states, and properties, differences in their content and purpose surface factors that are important to consider in keyboard interaction design.
        To address these factors, the following two sections describe separate keyboard interaction patterns for data and layout grids.
      </p>

      <section id="dataGrid" class="notoc">
        <h4>Data Grids For Presenting Tabular Information</h4>

        <p>
          A <code>grid</code> can be used to present tabular information that has column titles, row titles, or both.
          The <code>grid</code> pattern is particularly useful if the tabular information is editable or interactive.
          For example, when data elements are links to more information, rather than presenting them in a static table and including the links in the tab sequence, implementing the <code>grid</code> pattern provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation of the grid contents as well as a shorter tab sequence for the page.
          A <code>grid</code> may also offer functions, such as cell content editing, selection, cut, copy, and paste.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a grid that presents tabular data, every cell contains a focusable element or is itself focusable, regardless of whether the cell content is editable or interactive.
          There is one exception: if column or row header cells do not provide functions, such as sort or filter, they do not need to be focusable. One reason this is important is that screen readers need to be in their application reading mode, rather than their document reading mode, while the user is interacting with the grid.
          While in application reading mode, a screen reader user can only discover focusable elements and content that labels focusable elements.
          So, a screen reader user may unknowningly overlook elements contained in a grid that are either not focusable or not used to label a column or row.
          A more detailed description of this topic with examples is available in the section describing <a href="#ScreenReaderModes">screen reader document and application reading modes</a>.

          <p>
            The following keys provide grid navigation by moving focus among cells of the grid.
            These key commands are available by default after an element in the grid receives focus.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus one cell to the right.
              If focus is on the right-most cell in the row, focus does not move.
            </li>
            <li><kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus one cell to the left. If focus is on the left-most cell in the row, focus does not move.</li>

            <li><kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus one cell Up. If focus is on the top cell in the column, focus does not move.</li>
            <li><kbd>Page Down</kbd>: Moves focus down an author-determined number of rows, typically scrolling so the bottom row in the currently visible set of rows becomes one of the first visible rows. If focus is in the last row of the grid, focus does not move.</li>
            <li><kbd>Page Up</kbd>: Moves focus up an author-determined number of rows, typically scrolling so the top row in the currently visible set of rows becomes one of the last visible rows. If focus is in the first row of the grid, focus does not move.</li>
            <li><kbd>Home</kbd>: moves focus to the first cell in the row that contains focus.</li>
            <li><kbd>End</kbd>: moves focus to the last cell in the row that contains focus.</li>
            <li><kbd>Control + Home</kbd>: moves focus to the first cell in the first row.</li>
            <li><kbd>Control + End</kbd>: moves focus to the last cell in the last row.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="note">
            <li>
              When the above grid navigation keys move focus, whether the focus is set on an element inside the cell or the grid cell depends on cell content.

        <h4>Layout Grids for Grouping Widgets</h4>

        <p>
          The <code>grid</code> pattern  can be used to group a set of interactive elements, such as links, buttons,  or checkboxes.
          Since only one element in the entire grid is included in the tab sequence, grouping with a grid can dramatically reduce the number of tab stops on a page.
          This is especially valuable if scrolling through a list of elements dynamically loads more of those elements from a large data set, such as in a continuous list of suggested products on a shopping site.
          If elements in a list like this were in the tab sequence, keyboard users are effectively trapped in the list.
          If any elements in the group also have associated elements that appear on hover, the <code>grid</code> pattern is also useful for providing keyboard access to those contextual elements of the user interface.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike grids used to present data, A <code>grid</code> used for layout does not necessarily have header cells for labeling rows or columns and might contain only a single row or a single column.
          Even if it has multiple rows and columns, it may present a single, logically homogenous set of elements.
          For example, a list of recipients for a message may be a grid where each cell contains a link that represents a recipient.
          The grid may initially have a single row but then wrap into multiple rows as recipients are added.
          In such circumstances, grid navigation keys may also wrap so the user can read the list from beginning to end by pressing either <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>.
          While This type of focus movement wrapping can be very helpful in a layout grid, it would be disorienting if used in a data grid, especially for users of assistive technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because arrow keys are used to move focus inside of a <code>grid</code>, a <code>grid</code> is both easier to build and use if the components it contains do not require the arrow keys to operate.
          If a cell contains an element like a <a href="#Listbox">listbox</a>, then an extra key command to focus and activate the listbox is needed as well as a command for restoring the grid navigation functionality.
          Aproaches to supporting this need are described in the section on <a href="#gridNav_inside">Editing and Navigating Inside a Cell</a>.

        <h4>Keyboard Interaction - Setting Focus and Navigating Inside Cells</h4>

        <p>This section describes two important aspects of keyboard interaction design shared by both data and layout grid patterns:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Choosing whether a cell or an element inside a cell receives focus in response to grid navigation key events.</li>
          <li>Enabling grid navigation keys to be used to interact with elements inside of a cell.</li>

          <h5>Whether to Focus on a Cell Or an Element Inside IT</h5>

          <p>
            For assistive technology users, the quality of experience when navigating a grid heavily depends on both what a cell contains and on where keyboard focus is set.
            For example, if a cell contains a button and a grid navigation key places focus on the cell instead of the button, screen readers announce the button label but do not tell users a button is present.
          </p>

          <p>There are two optimal cell design and focus behavior combinations: </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              A cell contains one widget whose operation does not require arrow keys and grid navigation keys set focus on that widget.
              Examples of such widgets include link, button, menubutton, toggle button, radio button (not radio group), switch, and checkbox.
            </li>
            <li>A cell contains text or a single graphic and grid navigation keys set focus on the cell.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            While any combination of widgets, text, and graphics may be included in a single cell, grids that do not follow one of these two cell design and focus movement patterns add complexity for authors or users or both.
            The reference implementations included in the example section below demonstrate some strategies for making other cell designs as accessible as possible, but the most widely accessible experiences are likely to come by applying the above two patterns.

            While navigation keys, such as arrow keys, are moving focus from cell to cell, they are not available to perform actions like operate a combobox or move an editing caret inside of a cell. The user may need keys that are used for grid navigation to operate

      <h3>Listbox</h3>

      <p>
        A <a href="#listbox" class="role-reference">listbox</a> widget presents a list of options and allows a user to select one or more of them.
        A listbox that allows a single option to be chosen is a single-select listbox; one that allows multiple options to be selected is a multi-select listbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        When screen readers present a listbox, they may render the name, state, and position of each option in the list.
        The name of an option is a string calculated by the browser, typically from the content of the option element.
        As a flat string, the name does not contain any semantic information.
        Thus, if an option contains a semantic element, such as a heading, screen reader users will not have access to the semantics.
        In addition, the interaction model conveyed by the listbox role to assistive technologies does not support interacting with elements inside of an option.
        Because of these traits of the listbox widget, it does not provide an accessible way to present a list of interactive elements, such as links, buttons, or checkboxes.
        To present a list of interactive elements, see the <a href="#grid">grid</a> pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoiding very long option names facilitates understandability and perceivability for screen reader users.
        The entire name of an option is spoken as a single unit of speech when the option is read.
        When too much information is spoken as the result of a single key press, it is difficult to understand.
        Long names inhibit perception by increasing the impact of interrupted speech because users typically have to re-read the entire option.
      And, if the user does not understand what is spoken, reading the name by character, word, or phrase may be a difficult operation for many screen reader users in the context of a listbox widget.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sets of options where each option name starts with the same word or phrase can also significantly degrade usability for keyboard and screen reader users.
        Scrolling through the list to find a specific option becomes inordinately time consuming for a screen reader user who must listen to that word or phrase repeated before hearing what is unique about each option.
        For example, if a listbox for choosing a city were to contain options where each city name were preceded by a country name, and if many cities were listed for each country, a screen reader user would have to listen to the country name before hearing each city name.
        In such a scenario, it would be better to have 2 list boxes, one for country and one for city.

           <li><kbd>Home</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to first option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus. Supporting this key is strongly recommended for lists with more than five options.</li>
           <li><kbd>End</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to last option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus. Supporting this key is strongly recommended for lists with more than five options.</li>
          <li>Type-ahead is recommended for all listboxes, especially those with more than seven options:
            <ul>
              <li>Type a character: focus moves to the next item with a name that starts with the typed character.</li>

          <li><strong>Multiple Selection</strong>:
            Authors may implement either of two interaction models to support multiple selection:
            a recommended model that does not require the user to hold a modifier key, such as <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd>, while navigating the list
            or an alternative model that does require modifier keys to be held while navigating in order to avoid losing selection states.
            <ul>
              <li>Recommended selection model -- holding modifier keys is not necessary:
                <ul>

                  <li><kbd>Shift + Down Arrow</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selected state of the next option.</li>
                  <li><kbd>Shift + Up Arrow</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selected state of the previous option.</li>
                  <li><kbd>Shift + Space</kbd> (Optional): Selects contiguous items from the most recently selected item to the focused item.</li>
                  <li><kbd>Control + Shift + Home</kbd> (Optional): Selects the focused option and all options up to the first option.</li>
                  <li><kbd>Control + Shift + End</kbd> (Optional): Selects the focused option and all options down to the last option.</li>
                  <li><kbd>Control + A</kbd> (Optional): Selects all options in the list. Optionally, if all options are selected, it may also unselect all options.</li>

              <li>Alternative selection model -- moving focus without holding a <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> modifier unselects all selected nodes except the focused node:

            Having selection follow focus can be very helpful in some circumstances and can severely degrade accessibility in others.

        A menubar is typically horizontal and is often used to create a menu bar similar to those found near the top of the window in many desktop applications, offering the user quick access to a consistent set of commands.
      </p>

      <p>A common convention for indicating that a menu item launches a dialog box is to append &quot;&#8230;&quot; (ellipsis) to the menu item label, e.g., &quot;Save as &#8230;&quot;.</p>

                Note that if the <code>menubar</code> were not present, e.g., the menus were opened from a menubutton, <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> would not do anything when focus is on an item that does not have a submenu.

          <li>Any key that corresponds to a printable character (Optional): Move focus to   the next menu item in the current menu whose label begins with that printable character.</li>
          <li><kbd>Escape</kbd>: Close the menu that contains focus and return focus to   the element or context, e.g., menu button or parent <code>menuitem</code>, from which the menu was opened. </li>
          <li><kbd>Tab</kbd>: Moves focus to the next element in the tab sequence, and if the item that had focus is not in a <code>menubar</code>, closes its <code>menu</code> and all open parent <code>menu</code> containers.</li>
          <li><kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>: Moves focus to the previous element in the tab sequence, and if the item that had focus is not in a <code>menubar</code>, closes its <code>menu</code> and all open parent <code>menu</code> containers.</li>

          <li>
            If a menu is opened or a menubar receives focus as a result of a context action, <kbd>Escape</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> may return focus to   the invoking context.
            For example, a rich text editor may have a menubar that receives focus when a shortcut key, e.g., <kbd>alt + F10</kbd>, is pressed while editing.
            In this case, pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> or activating a command from the menu may return focus to the editor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although it is recommended that authors avoid doing so, some implementations of navigation menubars may have <code>menuitem</code> elements that both perform a function and open a submenu.
            In such implementations, <kbd>enter</kbd> and <kbd>Space</kbd> perform a navigation function, e.g., load new content,
            while <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>, in a horizontal menubar, opens the submenu associated with that same <code>menuitem</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            When items in a <code>menubar</code> are arranged vertically and items in <code>menu</code> containers are arranged horizontally:
            <ol>
              <li><kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> performs as <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> is described above, and vice versa.</li>
              <li><kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> performs as <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> is described above, and vice versa.</li>

        <h4>WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A menu is a container of items that represent choices. The element serving as the menu has a role of either <a href="#menu" class="role-reference">menu</a> or   <a href="#menubar" class="role-reference">menubar</a>. </li>
          <li>The items contained in a menu are child elements of the containing menu or menubar and have any of the following roles:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#menuitem" class="role-reference">menuitem</a></li>
              <li><a href="#menuitemcheckbox" class="role-reference">menuitemcheckbox</a></li>
              <li><a href="#menuitemradio" class="role-reference">menuitemradio</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If activating a <a href="#menuitem" class="role-reference">menuitem</a> opens a submenu, the menuitem is known as a parent menuitem.
            A submenu's <code>menu</code> element is contained in or owned by it's parent             menuitem.
          <li>
          A parent menuitem has either
            <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-label">aria-label</a> or <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a>
            set to specify a label.
            Warning: parent menuitems missing a label are labeled by             all child elements,
            causing screen readers to announce every child menuitem and often making a menu so verbose that it is unusable.
          </li>
          <li>A parent menuitem has <a href="#aria-haspopup" class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</a> set to <code>true</code>. </li>
          <li>One of the following approaches is used to enable scripts to move focus among items in a menu as described in <a href="#kbd_general_within"></a>:
            <ul>
              <li>The menu container has <code>tabindex</code> set to <code>-1</code> or <code>0</code> and <a href="#aria-activedescendant" class="property-reference">aria-activedescendant</a> set to the ID of the focused item. </li>
              <li>Each item in the menu has <code>tabindex</code> set to <code>-1</code>, except in a menubar, where the first item has <code>tabindex</code> set to <code>0</code>. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When a <a href="#menuitemcheckbox" class="role-reference">menuitemcheckbox</a> or <a href="#menuitemradio" class="role-reference">menuitemradio</a> is checked, <a href="#aria-checked" class="property-reference">aria-checked</a> is set to <code>true</code>. </li>
          <li>When a menu item is disabled, <a href="#aria-disabled" class="state-reference">aria-disabled</a> is set to <code>true</code>.</li>
          <li>Items in a menu may be divided into groups by placing an element with a role of <a href="#separator" class="role-reference">separator</a> between groups. For example, this technique should be used when a menu contains a set of <a href="#menuitemradio" class="role-reference">menuitemradio</a> items. </li>
          <li>All <a href="#separator" class="role-reference">separators</a> should have <a href="#aria-orientation" class="property-reference">aria-orientation</a> consistent with the separator's orientation. </li>
          <li>
            If a menubar is vertically oriented, it has <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-orientation">aria-orientation</a> set to <code>vertical</code>.
            The default value of <code>aria-orientation</code> for a menubar is <code>horizontal</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a menu is horizontally oriented, it has <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-orientation">aria-orientation</a> set to <code>horizontal</code>.
            The default value of <code>aria-orientation</code> for a menu is <code>vertical</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">If <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> is set on the menu container to include elements that are not DOM children of the container, those elements will appear in the reading order in the sequence they are referenced and after any items that are DOM children. Scripts that manage focus need to ensure the visual focus order matches this assistive technology reading order. </p>

      <p>
        A multi-thumb slider is a slider with two or more thumbs that each set a value in a group of related values.
        Many two-thumb sliders set a maximum and minimum value for a range, and the thumbs are not allowed to pass one another.
        That is, the mthumb that sets the upper value of the range can not be set lower than the thumb that controls the lower value of the range.
        However, in some multi-thumb sliders, each thumb sets a value that does not depend on the other thumb values.

      <h3>Spinbutton</h3>
      <p>
        A spinbutton is an input widget that restricts its value to a set or range of discrete values.
        For example, in a widget that enables users to set an alarm, a spinbutton could allow users to select a number from 0 to 59 for the minute of an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spinbuttons often have three components, including a text field that displays the current value, an increment button, and a decrement button.
        The text field is usually the only focusable component because the increment and decrement functions are keyboard accessible via arrow keys.
        Typically, the text field also allows users to directly edit the value.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the range is large, a spinbutton may support changing the value in both small and large steps.
        For instance, in the alarm example, the user may be able to move by 1 minute with <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> and by 10 minutes with <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd>.
      </p>
      <section class="notoc">
        <h4>Keyboard Interaction</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Text editing keys: If the spinbutton text field allows directly editing the value, the following keys are supported.
            <ul>
              <li>Standard single line text field keys, such as <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>, <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>, <kbd>Shift + Left Arrow</kbd>, <kbd>Shift + Right Arrow</kbd>, and <kbd>Delete</kbd>, for cursor movement, selecting text, and text deletion.</li>
              <li>
                Characters that are permitted to be part of the value.
                For example, an hour-and-minute spinner would allow only integer values from 0 to 59, the colon ':', and the letters 'AM' and 'PM'.
                Any other character input does not change the contents of the text field nor the value of the spinbutton.

      <h3>Tabs</h3>
      <p>
        Tabs are a set of layered sections of content, known as tab panels, that display one panel of content at a time.
        Each tab panel has an associated tab element, that when activated, displays the panel.
        The list of tab elements is arranged along one edge of the currently displayed panel, most commonly the top edge.
      </p>
      <p>Terms used to describe this design pattern include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Tabs or Tabbed Interface</dt>
        <dd>A set of tab elements and their associated tab panels.</dd>
        <dt>Tab List</dt>
        <dd>A set of tab elements contained in a <a href="#tablist" class="role-reference">tablist</a> element.</dd>
        <dt><a href="#tab" class="role-reference">tab</a></dt>
        <dd>An element in the tab list that serves as a label for one of the tab panels and can be activated to display that panel. </dd>
        <dt><a href="#tabpanel" class="role-reference">tabpanel</a></dt>
        <dd>The element that contains the content associated with a tab.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        When a tabbed interface is initialized, one tab panel is displayed and its associated tab is styled to indicate that it is active.
        When the user activates one of the other tab elements, the previously displayed tab panel is hidden, the tab panel associated with the activated tab becomes visible, and the tab is considered "active".

        <p>For the tab list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <kbd>Tab</kbd>: When focus moves into the tab list, places focus on the active <code>tab</code> element .
            When the tab list contains the focus, moves focus to the next element in the page tab sequence outside the tablist, which is typically either the first focusable element inside the tab panel or the tab panel itself.

                Optionally, activates the newly focused tab (See note below).
              </li>
              <li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When focus is on a tab in a tablist with either horizontal or vertical orientation:
            <ul>

              <li><kbd>Home</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to the first tab</li>
              <li><kbd>End</kbd> (Optional): Moves focus to the last tab.</li>
              <li><kbd>Shift + F10</kbd>: If the tab has an associated pop-up menu, opens the menu. </li>
              <li>
                <kbd>Delete</kbd> (Optional): If deletion is allowed, deletes (closes) the current tab element and its associated tab panel.
                If any tabs remain, sets focus to the tab following the tab that was closed and activates the newly focused tab.
                Alternatively, or in addition, the delete function is available in a context menu.

        </ul>
        <ol class="note">
          <li>
            It is recommended that tabs activate automatically when they receive focus as long as their associated tab panels are displayed without noticeable latency.
            This typically requires tab panel content to be preloaded.
            Otherwise, automatic activation slows focus movement, which significantly hampers users' ability to navigate efficiently across the tab list.

        A tooltip is a popup that displays information related to an element when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.
        It typically appears after a small delay and disappears when <kbd>Escape</kbd> is pressed or on mouse out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tooltip widgets do not receive focus.
        A hover that contains focusable elements can be made using the

      <h3>Tree View</h3>
      <p>
        A tree view widget presents a hierarchical list.
        Any item in the hierarchy may have child items, and items that have children may be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the children.
        For example, in a file system navigator that uses a tree view to display folders and files,
        an item representing a folder can be expanded to reveal the contents of the folder, which may be files, folders, or both.
      </p>
      <p>Terms for understanding tree views include:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Node</dt>
        <dd>An item in a tree. </dd>
        <dt>Root Node</dt>
        <dd>Node at the base of the tree; it may have one or more child nodes but does not have a parent node.</dd>
        <dt>Child Node</dt>
        <dd>Node that has a parent; any node that is not a root node is a child node.</dd>
        <dt>End Node</dt>
        <dd>Node that does not have any child nodes; an end node may be either a root node or a child node.</dd>
        <dt>Parent Node</dt>
        <dd>Node with one or more child nodes. It can be open (expanded) or closed (collapsed).</dd>
        <dt>Open Node</dt>
        <dd>Parent node that is expanded so its child nodes are visible.</dd>
        <dt>Closed Node</dt>
        <dd>Parent node that is collapsed so the child nodes are not visible.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        When using a keyboard to navigate a tree, a visual keyboard indicator informs the user which node is focused.
        If the tree allows the user to choose just one item for an action, then it is known as a single-select tree, and the item with focus also has a selected state.
        However, in multi-select trees, which enable the user to select more than one item for an action, the selected state is independent of the focus.
        For example, in a typical file system navigator, the user can move focus to select any number of files for an action, such as copy or move.
        It is important that the visual design distinguish between items that are selected and the item that has focus.
        For more details, see <a href="#kbd_focus_vs_selection">this description of differences between focus and selection.</a>

      <h3>Window Splitter</h3>
      <p>
        Work is in progress on this design pattern and is tracked by
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/129">issue 129.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A window splitter is a moveable separator between two sections, or panes, of a window that enables users to change the relative size of the panes.
        A Window Splitter can be either variable or fixed.
        A fixed splitter toggles between two positions whereas a variable splitter can be adjusted to any position within an allowed range.
      </p>
      <p>
        A window splitter has a value that represents the size of one of the panes, which, in this pattern,  is called the primary pane.
        When the splitter has its minimum value, the primary pane has its smallest size and the secondary pane has its largest size.
        The splitter also has an accessible name that matches the name of the primary pane.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider a book reading application with a primary pane for the table of contents and a secondary pane that displays content from a section of the book.
        The two panes are divided by a vertical splitter labeled &quot;Table of Contents&quot;.
        When the table of contents pane has its maximum size, the splitter has a value of <code>100</code>,
        and when the table of contents is completely collapsed, the splitter has a value of <code>0</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the term &quot;primary pane&quot; does not describe the importance or purpose of content inside the pane.

    <h2>Landmark Regions</h2>
    <p>
      ARIA landmark roles provide a powerful way to identify the organization and structure of a web page.
      By classifying and labeling sections of a page, they enable structural information that is conveyed visually through layout to be represented programmatically.
      Screen readers exploit landmark roles to provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page.
      Landmark regions can also be used as targets for &quot;skip links&quot; and by browser extensions to enhanced keyboard navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section explains how HTML5 sectioning elements and ARIA landmark roles
      are used to make it easy for assistive technology users to understand the meaning of the layout of a page.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>HTML5 Sectioning Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Several HTML5 sectioning elements automatically create ARIA landmark regions.
        So, in order to provide assistive technology users with a logical view of a page,
        it is important to understand the effects of using HTML5 sectioning elements.

      <h3>General Principles of Landmark Design</h3>
      <p>
        Including <strong>all content</strong> on a page in one of its landmark regions
        and giving each landmark region a semantically meaningful role
        is one of the most effective ways of ensuring assistive technology users will not overlook information that is relevant to their needs.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Step 1: Identify the logical structure</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Break the page into perceivable areas of content which designers typically indicate visually using alignment and spacing.</li>

        <li>Areas can be further defined into logical sub-areas as needed.</li>

        <li>An example of a sub-area is a portlet in a portal application.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 2: Assign landmark roles to each area</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Assign landmark roles based on the type of content in the area.</li>

        <li><code>banner</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>complementary</code> and <code>contentinfo</code> landmarks should be top level landmarks.</li>

        <li>Landmark roles can be nested to identify parent/child relationships of the information being presented.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Step 3: Label areas</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li>If a specific landmark role is used more than once on a web page, it should have a unique label.</li>

        <li>If a landmark is only used once on the page it may not require a label. See Landmark Roles section below. </li>

        <li>If an area begins with a heading element (e.g. <code>h1-h6</code>) it can be used as the label for the area using the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute.</li>

        <li>If an area requires a label and does not have a heading element, provide a label using the <code>aria-label</code> attribute.</li>

        <li>
          Do not use the landmark role as part of the label.
          For example, a navigation landmark with a label &quot;Site Navigation&quot; will be announced by a screen reader as &quot;Site Navigation Navigation&quot;.
          The label should simply be &quot;Site&quot;.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Landmark Roles</h3>

      <section class="widget" id="aria_lh_banner">

        <p>
          A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#banner"><code>banner</code></a> landmark identifies site-oriented content at the beginning of each page within a website. Site-oriented content typically includes things such as the logo or identity
          of the site sponsor, and site-specific search tool. A banner usually appears at the top of the page and typically spans the full width.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Each page may have one <code>banner</code> landmark.</li>

          <li>The <code>banner</code> landmark should be a top-level landmark.</li>

          <li>When a page contains nested <code>document</code> and/or <code>application</code> roles (e.g. typically through the use of <code>iframe</code> and <code>frame</code> elements), each <code>document</code> or <code>application</code> role may have
            one <code>banner</code> landmark.</li>

          <li>If a page includes more than one <code>banner</code> landmark, each should have a unique label (see Step 3 above).</li>

          when separated from the main content.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><code>complementary</code> landmarks should be top level landmarks (e.g. not contained within any other landmarks).</li>

          <li>If the complementary content is not related to the main content, a more general role should be assigned (e.g. <code>region</code>).</li>

      This section is work in progress.
      Development of the next revision is tracked by

    <p>
      Unlike native HTML form elements, browsers do not provide keyboard support for graphical user interface (GUI) components that are made accessible with ARIA; authors have to provide the keyboard support in their code.
      This section describes the principles and methods for making the functionality of a web page that includes ARIA widgets, such as menus and grids, as well as interactive components, such as toolbars and dialogs, operable with a keyboard.
      Along with the basics of focus management, this section offers guidance toward the objective of providing experiences to people who rely on a keyboard that are as efficient and enjoyable as the experiences available to others.
    </p>
      <p>This section covers: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Understanding fundamental principles of focus movement conventions used in ARIA design patterns.</li>
      <li>Maintaining visible focus, predictable focus movement, and distinguishing between keyboard focus and the selected state.</li>
      <li>Managing movement of keyboard focus between components, e.g., how the focus moves when the <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> keys are pressed.</li>
      <li>Managing movement of keyboard focus inside components that contain multiple focusable elements, e.g., two different methods for programatically exposing focus inside widgets like radio groups, menus, listboxes, trees, and grids.</li>
      <li>Determining when to make disabled interactive elements focusable.</li>
      <li>Assigning and revealing keyboard shortcuts, including guidance on how to avoid problematic conflicts with keyboard commands of assistive technologies, browsers, and operating systems.</li>

      <h3>Fundamental Keyboard Navigation Conventions</h3>

      <p>
        ARIA roles, states, and properties model accessibility behaviors and features shared among GUI components of popular desktop GUIs, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and GNOME.
        Similarly, ARIA design patterns borrow user expectations and keyboard conventions from those platforms, consistently incorporating common conventions with the aim of facilitating easy learning and efficient operation of keyboard interfaces across the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a web page to be accessible, all interactive elements must be operable via the keyboard.
        In addition, consistent application of the common GUI keyboard interface conventions described in the <a href="#aria_ex">ARIA design patterns</a> is important, especially for assistive technology users.
        Consider, for example, a screen reader user operating a tree.
        Just as familiar visual styling helps users discover how to expand a tree branch with a mouse, ARIA attributes give the tree the sound and feel of a tree in a desktop application.
        So, screen reader users will commonly expect that pressing the right arrow key will expand a collapsed node.
        Because the screen reader knows the element is a tree, it also has the ability to instruct a novice user how to operate it.
        Similarly, voice recognition software can implement commands for expanding and collapsing branches because it recognizes the element as a tree and can execute appropriate keyboard commands.
        All this is only possible if the tree implements the GUI keyboard conventions as described in the <a href="#TreeView">ARIA tree pattern</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A primary keyboard navigation convention common across all platforms is that the <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>shift+tab</kbd> keys move focus from one UI component to another while other keys, primarily the arrow keys, move focus inside of components that include multiple focusable elements.
        The path that the focus follows when pressing the <kbd>tab</kbd> key is known as the tab sequence or tab ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common examples of UI components that contain multiple focusable elements are radio groups, tablists, menus, and grids.
        A radio group, for example, contains multiple radio buttons, each of which is focusable.
        However, only one of the radio buttons is included in the tab sequence.
        After pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key moves focus to a radio button in the group, pressing arrow keys moves focus among the radio buttons in the group, and pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key moves focus out of the radio group to the next element in the tab sequence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ARIA specification refers to a discrete UI component that contains multiple
        focusable elements as a <a href="#composite" class="role-reference">composite</a>
        widget. The process of controlling focus movement inside a composite is called
        managing focus. Following are some ARIA design patterns with example implementations
        that demonstrate focus management:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="#combobox">Combobox</a></li>
        <li><a href="#grid">Grid</a></li>

      <h3>Discernable and Predictable Keyboard Focus</h3>
      <p>Work to complete this section is tracked by <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues/217">issue 217.</a></p>
      <p>
        When operating with a keyboard, two essentials of a good experience are the abilities to easily discern the location of the keyboard focus and to discover where focus landed after a navigation key has been pressed.
        The following factors affect to what extent a web page affords users these capabilities.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Visibility of the focus indicator: Users need to be able to easily distinguish the keyboard focus indicator from other features of the visual design. Just as a mouse user may move the mouse to help find the mouse pointer, a keyboard user may press a navigation key to watch for movement. If visual changes in response to focus movement are subtle, many users will lose track of focus and be unable to operate. Authors are advised to rely on the default focus indicators provided by browsers. If overriding the default, consider:
          <ul>
            <li>something about ... Colors and gradients can disappear in high contrast modes.</li>
            <li>Users need to be able to easily distinguish between focus and selection as described in <a href="#kbd_focus_vs_selection"></a>, especially when a component that contains selected elements does not contain the focus.</li>
            <li>... other considerations to be added ...</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Persistence of focus: It is essential that there is always a component within the user interface that is active (document.activeElement is not null or is not the body element) and that the active element has a visual focus indicator.
          Authors need to manage events that effect the currently active element so focus remains visible and moves logically.
          For example, if the user closes a dialog or performs a destructive operation like deleting an item from a list, the active element may be hidden or removed from the DOM.
          If such events are not managed to set focus on the button that triggered the dialog or on the list item following the deleted item, browsers move focus to the body element, affectively causing a loss of focus within the user interface.
        </li>

        <li>
          Predictability of movement: Usability of a keyboard interface is heavily influenced by how readily users can guess where focus will land after a navigation key is pressed.
          Some possible approaches to optimizing predictability include:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Move focus in a pattern that matches the reading order of the page's language. In left to right languages, for example, create a tab sequence that moves focus left to right and then top to bottom.
            </li>

            <li>
              Incorporate all elements of a section of the page in the tab sequence before moving focus to another section. For instance, in a page
              with multiple columns that has content in a left side bar, center region, and right side bar, build a tab sequence that covers all elements in the left sidebar before focus moves to the first focusable element in the center column.
            </li>

            <li>
              When the distance between two consecutive elements in the tab sequence is significant, avoid movement that would be perceived as backward.
              For example, on a page with a left to right language, a jump from the last element in the bottom right of the main content to the top element in a left-hand sidebar is likely to be less predictable and more difficult to follow, especially for users with a narrow field of view.
            </li>

            <li>
              Follow consistent patterns across a site.
              The keyboard experience is more predictable when similar pages have similar focus movement patterns.
            </li>

            <li>Do not set initial focus when the page loads except in cases where:
              <ul>
                <li>The page offers a single, primary function that nearly all users employ immediately after page load.</li>
                <li>Any given user is likely to use the page often.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <section id="kbd_focus_vs_selection">
      <h3>Focus VS Selection and the Perception of Dual Focus</h3>

      <p>
        Occasionally, it may appear as if two elements on the page have focus at the same time.
        For example, in a multi-select list box, when an option is selected it may be greyed.
        Yet, the focus indicator can still be moved to other options, which may also be selected.
        Similarly, when a user activates a tab in a tablist, the selected state is set on the tab and its visual appearance changes.
        However, the user can still navigate, moving the focus indicator elsewhere on the page while the tab retains its selected appearance and state.
      </p>

      <p>
        Focus and selection are quite different.
        From the keyboard user's perspective, focus is a pointer, like a mouse pointer; it tracks the path of navigation.
        There is only one point of focus at any time and all operations take place at the point of focus.
        On the other hand, selection is an operation that can be performed in some widgets, such as list boxes, trees, and tablists.
        If a widget supports only single selection, then only one item can be selected and very often the selected state will simply follow the focus when focus is moved inside of the widget.
        That is, in some widgets, moving focus may also perform the select operation.
        However, if the widget supports multiple selection, then more than one item can be in a selected state, and keys for moving focus do not perform selection.
        Some multi-select widgets do support key commands that both move focus and change selection, but those keys are different from the normal navigation keys.
        Finally, when focus leaves a widget that includes a selected element, the selected state persists.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the developer's perspective, the difference is simple -- the focused element is the active element (document.activeElement).
        Selected elements are elements that have <code>aria-selected="true"</code>.
      </p>

      <p>With respect to focus and the selected state, the most important considerations for designers and developers are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The visual focus indicator must always be visible.</li>
        <li>The selected state must be visually distinct from the the focus indicator.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="kbd_selection_follows_focus">
      <h3>Deciding When to Make Selection Automatically Follow Focus</h3>
      <p>
        in composite widgets where only one element may be selected, such as a tablist or single-select listbox, moving the focus may also cause the focused element to become the selected element.
        This is called having selection follow focus.
        Having selection follow focus is often beneficial to users, but in some circumstances, it is extremely detremental to accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in a tablist, the selected state is used to indicate which panel is displayed.
        So, when selection follows focus in a tablist, moving focus from one tab to another automatically changes  which panel is displayed.
        If the content of panels is present in the DOM, then displaying a new panel is nearly instantaneous.
        A keyboard user who wishes to display the fourth of six tabs can do so with 3 quick presses of the right arrow.
        And, a screen reader user who perceives the labels on tabs by navigating through them may efficiently read through the complete list without any latency.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if displaying a new panel causes a network request and possibly a page refresh, the effect of having selection automatically focus can be devistating to the experience for keyboard and screen reader users.
        In this case, displaying the fourth tab or reading through the list becomes a tedious and time-consuming task as the user experiences significant latency with each movement of focus.
        Further, if displaying a new tab refreshes the page, then the user not only has to wait for the new page to load but also return focus to the tab list.
      </p>
      <p>
        When selection does not follow focus, the user changes which element is selected by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> key.

      <h3>Keyboard Navigation Between Components (The Tab Sequence)</h3>

      <p>
        As explained in section <a href="#kbd_generalnav"></a>, all interactive UI components need to be reachable vai the keyboard.
        This is best achieved by either including them in the tab sequence or by making them accessible from a component that is in the tab sequence, e.g., as part of a composite component.
        This section addresses building and managing the tab sequence, and subsequent sections cover making focusable elements that are contained within components keyboard accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#attr-tabindex">HTML tabindex</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#tabindexattribute">SVG tabindex</a> attributes can be used to add and remove elements from the tab sequence.
        The value of tabindex can also influence the order of the tab sequence, although authors are strongly advised not to use tabindex for that purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        In HTML, the default tab sequence of a web page includes only links and HTML form elements, except In Mac OS, where it includes only form elements.
        Mac OS system preferences include a keyboard setting that enables the tab key to move focus to all focusable elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default order of elements in the tab sequence is the order of elements in the DOM.
        The DOM order also determines screen reader reading order.
        It is important to keep the keyboard tab sequence and the screen reader reading order aligned, logical, and predictable as described in <a href="#kbd_focus_discernable_predictable"></a>.
        The most robust method of manipulating the order of the tab sequence while also maintaining alignment with the reading order that is currently available in all browsers is rearranging elements in the DOM.
      </p>

      <p>The values of the tabindex attribute have the following effects.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>tabindex is not present or does not have a valid value</dt>
        <dd>
          The element has its default focus behavior.
          In HTML, only form controls and anchors with an HREF attribute are included in the tab sequence.
        </dd>
        <dt>tabindex="0"</dt>
        <dd>The element is included in the tab sequence based on its position in the DOM.</dd>
        <dt>tabindex="-1"</dt>
        <dd>The element is not included in the tab sequence but is focusable with element.focus().</dd>
        <dt>tabindex="X" where X is an integer in the range 1 &lt;= X &lt;= 32767</dt>
        <dd>
          Authors are strongly advised NOT to use these values.
          The element is placed in the tab sequence based on the value of tabindex.
          Elements with a tabindex value of 0 and elements that are focusable by default will be in the sequence after elements with a tabindex value of 1 or greater.
        </dd>
      </dl>

    <section id="kbd_general_within">
      <h3> Keyboard Navigation Inside Components</h3>

      <p>
        As described in section <a href="#kbd_generalnav"></a>, the tab sequence should include only one focusable element of a composite UI component.
        Once a composite contains focus, keys other than <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> enable the user to move focus among its focusable elements.
        Authors are free to choose which keys move focus inside of a composite, but they are strongly advised to use the same key bindings as similar components in common GUI operating systems as demonstrated in <a href="#aria_ex"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The convention for where focus lands in a composite when it recieves focus as a result of a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key event depends on the type of composite.
        It is typically one of the following.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The element that had focus the last time the composite contained focus.
          Or, if the composite has not yet contained the focus, the first element.
          Widgets that usually employ this pattern include grid and tree grid.
        </li>

        <li>
          The selected element. Or, if there is no selected element, the first element.
          Widgets where this pattern is commonly implemented include radio groups, tabs, list boxes, and trees.
          Note: For radio groups, this pattern is referring to the checked radio button; the selected state is not supported for radio buttons.
        </li>

        <li>
          The first element.
          Components that typically follow this pattern include menubars and toolbars.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The following sections explain two strategies for managing focus inside composite elements: creating a roving tabindex and using the aria-activedescendant property.
      </p>

      <section id="kbd_roving_tabindex">
        <h4>Managing Focus Within Components Using a Roving tabindex</h4>

        <p>
          When using roving tabindex to manage focus in a composite UI component, the element that is to be included in the tab sequence has tabindex of "0" and all other focusable elements contained in the composite have tabindex of "-1".
          The algorithm for the roving tabindex strategy is as follows.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>When the component container is loaded or created, set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the element that will initially be included in the tab sequence and set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on all other focusable elements it contains.</li>
          <li>
            When the component contains focus and the user presses a navigation key that moves focus within the component, such as an arrow key:

            <ul>
              <li>set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on the element that has <code>tabindex="0"</code>.</li>
              <li>Set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the element that will become focused as a result of the key event.</li>
              <li>Set focus, <code>element.focus()</code>, on the element that has <code>tabindex="0"</code>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            If the design calls for a specific element to be focused the next time the user moves focus into the composite with <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>, check if that target element has <code>tabindex="0"</code> when the composite loses focus.
            If it does not, set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the target element and set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on the element that previously had <code>tabindex="0"</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One benefit of using roving tabindex rather than aria-activedescendant to manage focus is that the user agent will scroll the newly focused element into view.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="kbd_focus_activedescendant">
        <h4>Managing Focus in Composites Using aria-activedescendant</h4>

        <p>
          If a component container has an ARIA role that supports the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property, it is not necessary to manipulate the tabindex attribute and move DOM focus among focusable elements within the container.
          Instead, only the container element needs to be included in the tab sequence. When the container has DOM focus, the value of aria-activedescendant on the container tells assistive technologies which element is active within the widget.
          Assistive technologies will consider the element referred to as active to be the focused element even though DOM focus is on the element that has the aria-activedescendant property.
          And, when the value of aria-activedescendant is changed, assistive technologies will receive focus change events equivalent to those received when DOM focus actually moves.
        </p>

        <p>The steps for using the aria-activedescendant method of managing focus are as follows.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            When the container element that has a role that supports aria-activedescendant is loaded or created, ensure that:

            <ul>
              <li>The container element is included in the tab sequence as described in <a href="#kbd_general_between"></a> or it is otherwise focusable as described in <a href="#kbd_nested_components"></a>.</li>
              <li>
                It has <code>aria-activedescendant="IDREF"</code> where IDREF is the ID of the element within the container that should be identified as active when the widget receives focus.
                The referenced element needs to meet the DOM relationship requirements described below.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            When the container element receives DOM focus, draw a visual focus indicator on the active element and ensure the active element is scrolled into view.
            See section <a href="#scrollintoview">Managing Focus with Scroll</a> below for more information.
          </li>

          <li>
            When the composite widget contains focus and the user presses a navigation key that moves focus within the widget, such as an arrow key:

            <ul>
              <li>Change the value of aria-activedescendant on the container to refer to the element that should be reported to assistive technologies as active.</li>
              <li>Move the visual focus indicator and, if necessary,  scrolled the active element into view.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            If the design calls for a specific element to be focused the next time a user moves focus into the composite with <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>, check if aria-activedescendant is referring to that target element when the container loses focus.
            If it is not, set aria-activedescendant to refer to the target element.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The <a href="#aria-activedescendant" class="property-reference">specification for aria-activedescendant</a> places important restrictions on the DOM relationship between the focused element that has the aria-activedescendant attribute and the element referenced as active by the value of the attribute.
          One of the following three conditions must be met.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>The element referenced as active is a DOM descendant of the focused referencing element.</li>

          <li>The focused referencing element has a value specified for the <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property that includes the ID of the element referenced as active.</li>

          <li>
            The focused referencing element has role of <a href="#textbox" class="role-reference">textbox</a> and has <a href="#aria-controls" class="property-reference">aria-controls</a> property referring to an element with a role that supports aria-activedescendant and either:

            <ol>
              <li>The element referenced as active is a descendant of the controlled element.</li>
              <li>The controlled element has a value specified for the <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property that includes the ID of the element referenced as active.</li>

      <h3>Focusability of disabled controls</h3>
      <p>
        By default, disabled HTML input elements are removed from the tab sequence.
        In most contexts, the normal expectation is that disabled interactive elements are not focusable.
        However, there are some contexts where it is common for disabled elements to be focusable, especially inside of composite widgets.
        For example, as demonstrated in the <a href="#menu"></a> pattern, disabled items are focusable when navigating through a menu with the arrow keys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Removing focusability from disabled elements can offer users both advantages and disadvantages.
        Allowing keyboard users to skip disabled elements usually reduces the number of key presses required to complete a task.
        However, preventing focus from moving to disabled elements can hide their presence from screen reader users who "see" by moving the focus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Authors are encouraged to adopt a consistent set of conventions for the focusability of disabled elements.
        The examples in this guide adopt the following conventions, which both reflect common practice and attempt to balance competing concerns.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>For elements that are in the tab sequence when enabled, remove them from the tab sequence when disabled.</li>

        <li>
          For the following composite widget elements, keep them focusable when disabled:

        </li>

        <li>
          For elements contained in a toolbar, make them focusable if discoverability is a concern. Here are two examples to aid with this judgment.

          <ol>
            <li>
              A toolbar with buttons for moving, removing, and adding items in a list includes buttons for &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, &quot;Add&quot;, and &quot;Remove&quot;.
              The &quot;Up&quot; button is disabled and its focusability is removed when the first item in the list is selected.
              Given the  presence of the &quot;Down&quot; button, discoverability of the &quot;Up&quot; button is not a concern.
            </li>

            <li>
              A toolbar in an editor contains a set of special smart paste functions that are disabled when the clipboard is empty or when the function is not applicable to the current content of the clipboard.
              It could be helpful to keep the disabled buttons focusable if the ability to discover their functionality is primarily via their presence on the toolbar.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>One design technique for mitigating the impact of including disabled elements in the path of keyboard focus is employing appropriate keyboard shortcuts as described in <a href="#kbd_shortcuts"></a>.</p>

        <h4>Designing the Scope and Behavior of Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>

        <p>This section explains the following factors when determining which elements and features to assign keyboard shortcuts and what behavior to give each shortcut:</p>

          <li>Ensuring discovery through navigation; keyboard shortcuts enhance, not replace, standard keyboard access.</li>

          <li>
            Effectively choosing from among the following behaviors:

            <ol>
              <li>Navigation: Moving focus to an element. </li>
              <li>Activation: Performing an operation associated with an element that does not have focus and might not be visible.</li>
              <li>Navigation and activation: Both moving focus to an element and activating it.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Balancing efficiency and cognitive load: lack of a shortcut can reduce efficiency while too many shortcuts can increase cognitive load and clutter the experience.</li>

          <h5>Ensure Basic Access Via Navigation </h5>

          <p>
            Before assigning keyboard shortcuts, it is essential to ensure the features and functions to which shortcuts may be assigned are keyboard accessible without a keyboard shortcut.
            In other words, all elements that could be targets for keyboard shortcuts need to be focusable via the keyboard using the methods described in:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="#kbd_general_between"></a> </li>
            <li><a href="#kbd_general_within"></a> </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Do not use keyboard shortcuts as a substitute for access via navigation.
            This is essential to full keyboard access because:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>The primary means of making functions and their shortcuts discoverable is by making the target elements focusable and revealing key assignments on the element itself.</li>
            <li>If people who rely on the keyboard have to read documentation to learn which keys are required to use an interface, the interface may technically meet some accessibility standards but in practice is only accessible to the small subset of them who have the knowledge that such documentation exists, have the extra time available, and the ability to retain the necessary information.</li>
            <li>Not all devices that depend on keyboard interfaces can support keyboard shortcuts.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="kbd_shortcuts_design_choose_behavior">
          <h5>Choose Appropriate Shortcut Behavior</h5>

          <p>The following conventions may help identify the most advantageous behavior for a keyboard shortcut.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Move focus when the primary objective is to make navigation more efficient, e.g., reduce the number of times the user must press <kbd>Tab</kbd> or the arrow keys.
              This behavior is commonly expected when assigning a shortcut to a text box, toolbar, or composite, such as a listbox, tree, grid, or menubar.
              This behavior is also useful for moving focus to a section of a page, such as the main content or a complementary landmark section.
            </li>

            <li>
              Activate an element without moving focus when the target context of the funtion is the context that contains the focus.
              This behavior is most common for command buttons and for functions associated with elements that are not visible, such as a "Save" option that is accessible via a menu.
              For example, if the focus is on an option in a listbox and a toolbar contains buttons for moving and removing options, it is most benefitial to keep focus in the listbox when the user presses a key shortcut for one of the buttons in the toolbar.
              This behavior can be particularly important for screen reader users because it provides confirmation of the action performed and makes performing multiple commands more efficient.
              For instance, when a screen reader user presses the shortcut for the "Up" button, the user will be able to hear the new position of the option in the list since it still has the focus.
              Similarly, when the user presses the shortcut for deleting an option, the user can hear the next option in the list and immediately decide whether to press the delete shortcut again.
            </li>

            <li>
              Move focus and activate when the target of the shortcut has a single function and the context of that function is the same as the target.
              This behavior is typical when a shortcut is assigned to a button that opens a menu or dialog, to a checkbox, or to a navigation link or button.

            The first goal when designing a keyboard interface is simple, efficient, and and intuitive operation with only basic keyboard navigation support.
            If basic operation of a keyboard interface is inefficient , attempting to compensate for fundamental design issues, such as suboptimal layout or command structure,  by implementing keyboard shortcuts will not likely reduce user frustration.
            The practical implication of this is that, in most well-designed user interfaces, the percentage of functionality that needs to be accessible via a keyboard shortcut in order to create optimal usability is not very high.
            In many simple user interfaces, keyboard shortcuts can be entirely superfluous.
            And, in user interfaces with too many keyboard shortcuts, the excess shortcuts create cognitive load that make the most useful ones more difficult to remember.

        <h4>Assigning Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
        <p>When choosing the keys to assign to a shortcut, there are many factors to consider.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Making the shortcut easy to learn and remember by using a mnemonic (e.g., "S" for "Save") or following a logical or spacial pattern.</li>
          <li> Localizing the interface, including for differences in which keys are available and how they behave and for language considerations that could impact mnemonics. </li>
          <li>Avoiding and managing conflicts with key assignments used by an assistive technology, the browser, or the operating system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Methods for designing a key shortcut scheme that supports learning and memory is beyond the scope of this guide.
          Unless the key shortcut scheme is extensive, it is likely sufficient to mimic concepts that are familiar from common desktop software, such as browsers.
          Similarly, while localization is important, describing how to address it is left to other resources that specialize in that topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remainder of this section provides guidance balancing requirements and concerns related to key assignment conflicts.
          It is typically ideal if key assignments do not conflict with keys that are assigned to functions in the user's operating system, browser, or assistive technology.
          Conflicts can block efficient access to functions that are essential to the user, and a perfect storm of conflicts can trap a user.
          At the same time, there are some circumstances where intentional conflicts are useful.
          And, given the vast array of operating system, browser, and assistive technology keys, it is almost impossible to be certain conflicts do not exist.
          So it is also important to employ strategies that mitigate the impact of conflicts whether they are intentional or unknown.

          <p>
            It is essential to avoid conflicts with keys that perform system level functions, such as appplication and window management and display and sound control.
            In general, this can be achieved by refraining from the following types of assignments.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Any modifier keys + any of <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd>, or <kbd>Escape</kbd>.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>
            In addition, there are some important application level features that most applications, including browsers, generally support.
            These include:

          <h5>Assistive Technology Key Connflicts</h5>

          <p>
            Even though assistive technologies have collectively taken thousands of key assignments, avoiding conflicts is relatively easy.
            This is because assistive technologies have had to develop key assignment schemes that avoid conflicts with both operating systems and applications.
            They do this by hijacking specific keys as modifiers that uniquely define their key commands.
            For example, many assistive technologies use the <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> key as a modifier.

            While there is considerable similarity among browser keyboard schemes, the patterns within the schemes are less homogenious.
            Consequently, it is more difficult to avoid conflicts with browser key assignments.
            While the impact of conflicts is sometimes mitigated by the availability of two paths to nearly every function -- keyboard accessible menus and keyboard shortcuts, avoiding conflicts with shortcuts to heavily used functions is nonetheless important.
            Pay special attention to avoiding conflicts with shortcuts to:

    <h2>Intentionally Hiding Semantics with the <code>presentation</code> Role</h2>
    <p>
      While ARIA is primarily used to express semantics, there are some situations where hiding an
      element’s semantics from assistive technologies is helpful. This is done with the
      <a href="#presentation" class="role-reference">presentation</a>
      role, which declares that an element is being used only for presentation and therefore does
      not have any accessibility semantics. The ARIA 1.1 specification also includes role
      <a href="#none" class="role-reference">none</a>
      , which serves as a synonym for <code>presentation</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider a tabs widget built using an HTML <code>ul</code> element.
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;ul role=&quot;tablist&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 1&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 2&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a role=&quot;tab&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Tab 3&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because the list is declared to be a tablist, the list items are not in a list context. It
      could confuse users if an assistive technology were to render those list items. Applying role
      <code>presentation</code> to the <code>li</code> elements tells browsers to leave those
      elements out of their accessibility tree. Assistive technologies will thus be unaware of the
      list item elements and see the tab elements as immediate children of the tablist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three common uses of role <code>presentation</code> are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hiding a decorative image; it is equivalent to giving the image null alt text. </li>
      <li>Suppressing table semantics of tables used for layout in circumstances where the table semantics do not convey meaningful relationships.</li>
      <li>Eliminating semantics of intervening orphan elements in the structure of a composite
        widget, such as a tablist, menu, or tree as demonstrated in the example above.</li>
    </ol>
    <section id="presentation_role_effects">
      <h3>
        Effects of Role <code>presentation</code>
      </h3>
      <p>
        When <code>role=&quot;presentation&quot;</code> is specified on an element, if a
        <a href="#presentation_role_ignored">condition that requires a browser to ignore the <code>presentation</code> role</a>
        does not exist, it has the following three effects.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The element’s implied ARIA role and any ARIA states and properties associated with
          that role are hidden from assistive technologies.</li>
        <li>
          Text contained by the element, i.e., inner text, as well as inner text of all its
          descendant elements remains visible to assistive technologies except, of course, when the
          text is explicitly hidden, e.g., styled with <code>display: none</code> or has <code>aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The roles, states, and properties of each descendant element remains visible to assistive
          technologies unless the descendant requires the context of the presentational
          element. For example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If <code>presentation</code> is applied to a <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code>
              element, each child <code>li</code> element inherrits the <code>presentation</code>
              role because ARIA requires the <code>listitem</code> elements to have the parent <code>list</code> element.
              So, the <code>li</code> elements are not exposed to assistive technologies,
              but elements contained inside of those <code>li</code> elements, including nested lists,  are visible to assistive technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, if <code>presentation</code> is applied to a <code>table</code> element,
              The descendant <code>caption</code>, <code>thead</code>, <code>tbody</code>, <code>tfooter</code>,
              <code>tr</code>, <code>th</code>, and <code>td</code>
              elements inherit role <code>presentation</code> and are thus not exposed to assistive technologies.
              But, elements inside of the <code>th</code> and <code>td</code> elements, including nested tables,  are exposed to assistive technologies.

    <h2>Roles That Automatically Hide Semantics by Making Their Descendants Presentational</h2>
    <p>
      There are some types of user interface components that, when represented in a platform
      accessibility API, can only contain text. For example, accessibility APIs do not have a way of
      representing semantic elements contained in a button. To deal with this limitation, WAI-ARIA
      requires browsers to automatically apply role <code>presentation</code> to all descendant
      elements of any element with a role that cannot support semantic children.
    </p>
    <p>The roles that require all children to be presentational are:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>slider</li>
      <li>switch</li>
      <li>tab</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For instance, consider the following tab element, which contains a heading.</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Because WAI-ARIA requires descendants of tab to be presentational,
      the following code is equivalent.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 role=&quot;presentation&quot;&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      And, from the perspective of anyone using a technology that relies on an accessibility API, such as a screen reader,
      the heading does not exist since the previous code is equivalent to the following.
    </p>
    <pre>
      &lt;li role=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Title of My Tab&lt;/li&gt;
    </pre>
