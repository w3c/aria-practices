	<p>This document provides readers with an understanding of how to use <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.1</a></cite> [[WAI-ARIA]] to create accessible rich internet applications. It describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification alone and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties. This document is directed primarily to Web application developers, but the guidance is also useful for user agent and assistive technology developers. </p>
	<p>This document is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">WAI-ARIA Overview</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="sotd"></section>
<section id="intro">
  <h2> Introduction</h2>
  <p>This section is <em>informative.</em></p>
  <p>The WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide is intended to provide an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA to create an accessible Rich Internet Application. It describes recommended WAI-ARIA usage patterns and provides an introduction to the concepts behind them.
  </p>
  <p>This guide is one part of a suite of resources that support the WAI-ARIA specification. The WAI-ARIA suite fills accessibility gaps identified by the [[WAI-ARIA-ROADMAP]].
  </p>
  <p>As explained in <a href="#ariaBackground">Background on WAI-ARIA</a>, 
    languages used to create rich and dynamic web sites, e.g., HTML, Javascript, CSS, and SVG, do not natively include all the features required to make sites usable by people who use assistive technologies (AT) or who rely on keyboard navigation. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Protocols and Formats working group (PFWG) is addressing these deficiencies through several W3C standards efforts, with a focus on the WAI-ARIA specifications. For an introduction to WAI-ARIA, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">Accessible Rich Internet   Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA) Overview</a>. 
  </p>
    <p>With the understanding many prefer to learn from examples, the guide begins with a section that demonstrates how to make common widgets accessible with descriptions of expected behaviors supported by working code.
  Where it is helpful to do so, the examples refer to detailed explainations of supporting concepts in subsequent sections.
  The sections that follow the examples first provide background that helps build understanding of how WAI-ARIA works and how it fits into the larger web technoloby picture.
  Next, the guide covers general steps for building an accessible widget  using WAI-ARIA, JavaScript, and CSS, including detailed guidance on how to make rich internet applications keyboard accessible. 
  The scope then widens to include the full application, addressing the page layout and structural semantics critical to enabling a usable experience with assistive technologies on pages containing both rich applications and rich documents. 
  It includes guidance on dynamic document management, use of WAI-ARIA Form properties, and the creation of WAI-ARIA-enabled alerts and dialogs.

<section id="aria_ex">
  <h2>Design Patterns and Widgets</h2>
  <p>This section demonstrates how to make common rich internet application widgets and patterns accessible by applying WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties and implementing keyboard support.</p>
<p class="note">Although users of Mac OS X are familiar with using the <kbd>Command</kbd> key instead of the <kbd>Control</kbd> key, the <kbd>Command</kbd> key is typically reserved for desktop applications and OS-level integration. Until device and platform independence can be addressed in WAI-ARIA 2.0, the primary <kbd>Control</kbd> modifier key for WAI-ARIA widget interaction is specified as <kbd>Control</kbd> on all platforms, including Mac OS X.</p>
  <section id="aria_ex_widget">
    <h3>Generally Applicable Keyboard Recommendations </h3>
    <p>The following keyboard conventions are applicable to many of the patterns described in subsequent sections. </p>
    <ul>
    <li><kbd>Shift+F10</kbd> opens associated context menu</li>
      <li><kbd>Control+C</kbd> Copies to clipboard </li>
      <li><kbd>Control+V</kbd> Pastes from clipboard </li>
      <li><kbd>Control+X</kbd> Copies to clipboard and cuts </li>
      <li><kbd>Control+Z</kbd> undo last action</li>
      <li><kbd>Control+Y</kbd> Redo action</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">The following guidance on nested widgets will be moved to another section.</p>
    <p><strong>Widgets within Widgets</strong> The general navigation model is for   a user to tab to a widget, interact with the controls in that widget and then   tab to move focus to the next widget in the tab order. 
    By extension, when the   construct of a widget contains another widget, tab will move focus to the   contained widget because it is the next item in the tab order. 
    This continues   down the layers of widgets until the last widget is reached. 
    For example, if there are two widgets A and B on a page where widget A contains within it Widget A1 and   Widget A1 contains within it Widget A2, the focus sequence when pressing the tab key would be A1, A2, A3, B.

            <td class="widget-description"><p>An accordion component is a collection of expandable panels associated with a common outer container. Panels consist of a header and an associated content region or panel. The primary use of an Accordion is to present multiple sections of content on a single page without scrolling, where all of the sections are peers in the application or object hierarchy. The general look is similar to a tree where each root tree node is an expandable accordion header. The user navigates and makes the contents of each panel visible (or not) by interacting with the Accordion Header. Terms for understanding accordions include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>accordion component:</dt><dd>Collection of panels within a common outer pane.</dd>
<dt>accordion header:</dt><dd>Label area of an accordion panel. This is where you find the control to expand or collapse the panels.</dd>

              <li><kbd>Tab</kbd> - When focus is on an accordion header, pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key moves focus in the following manner:
<ol>
                  <li>If interactive glyphs or menus are present in the accordion header, focus   moves to each in order. </li>
                  <li>When the corresponding panel is expanded (its <a href="#aria-expanded" class="state-reference">aria-expanded</a> state   is 'true'), then focus moves to the first focusable element in the panel. </li>
                  <li>If the  panel is collapsed (its aria-expanded state is 'false' or   missing), OR, when the last interactive element of a panel is   reached, the next <kbd>Tab</kbd> key press moves focus as follows:
                    <ul>
                      <li>If a subsequent accordion panel is already   expanded, focus moves to the first focusable element in this subsequent   panel. </li>
                      <li>If no subsequent accordion panel is expanded, focus moves to the first focusable element   outside the accordion component. </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>When focus is on the accordion header, a press of up/left arrow keys moves focus to   the previous logical accordion header. </li>
                  <li>When focus reaches the first header, further up/left arrow key presses optionally   wrap to the first header. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><kbd>Right arrow</kbd>
                <ul>
                  <li>When focus is on the accordion header, a press of down/right moves focus   to the next logical accordion header. </li>
                  <li>When focus reaches the last header, further down/right arrow key presses optionally   wrap to the first header </li>

              <li><kbd>Down arrow</kbd> - behaves the same as right arrow </li>
              <li><kbd>Control+Up arrow</kbd> - Moves focus from anywhere in the accordion   content to its associated accordion header or tab respectively. </li>
              <li><kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd> -
                <ul>
                  <li>When focus is inside of an accordion pane, pressing <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd> moves focus   to the accordion header of the previous accordion pane. </li>
                  <li>When focus is in the first accordion header content, pressing <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>  optionally moves focus to the last accordion header. </li>
                  <li>Focus will simply move to the header and will require <kbd>Enter/Space</kbd> to   expand/collapse the accordion pane. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> -
                <ul>
                  <li>When focus is inside of an accordion pane, pressing <kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> moves   focus to the header of the accordion pane. </li>
                  <li>When focus is in the last accordion header content, pressing <kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> optionally moves focus to the first accordion header. </li>
                  <li>In the case of an accordion, focus simply moves to the header and requires <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Space</kbd> to expand/collapse the accordion pane. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><kbd>End</kbd> - When focus is on the accordion header, an <kbd>End</kbd> key press moves  focus to the last accordion header. </li>
              <li><kbd>Home</kbd> - When focus is on the accordion header, a <kbd>Home</kbd> key press moves   focus to the first accordion header. </li>
              <li><kbd>Enter/Space</kbd> - When focus is on an accordion header, pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Space</kbd> toggles the expansion of the corresponding panel.
                <ul>
                  <li>If collapsed, the panel is expanded, and its aria-expanded state is set to   'true'. </li>
                  <li>If expanded, the panel is collapsed and its aria-expanded state is set to   'false'. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              
              <li><kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> - Generally the reverse of <kbd>Tab</kbd>.</li>
              
              <li><kbd>Alt+Delete</kbd> -
                
                <ul>
                
                  <li>When deletion is allowed, with focus anywhere within the tab panel or tab, pressing <kbd>Alt+Delete</kbd> will delete the current tab and tab panel from the tabbed interface control. If additional tabs remain in the tabbed interface, focus goes to the next tab in the tab list. If no additional tabs remain, then focus moves to the last place that held focus in the previous tab panel.</li>
                  
                  <li>An alternative to providing a keystroke to close a tab is to provide a context menu that is associated with the tab title. When focus is on the tab, pressing <kbd>Shift-F10</kbd> or pressing the right mouse button will open a context menu with the close choice.</li>
                                    
                  <li>A warning should be given to the user before allowing the delete to occur.</li>
                
                </ul>
</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In Firefox, pressing <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd> / <kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> moves between browser tabs. Firefox also supports <kbd>Control+Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Control+Shift+Tab</kbd> to move between tabs. Internet Explorer 7 also uses   <kbd>Control+Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Control+Shift+Tab</kbd>. There may be advantages to using   <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>PageDown</kbd> as the keys to change tabs because it is a recognizable   keystroke to at least Firefox users and it is also supported by the Windows   operating system to move between panels in a tabbed dialog.</p>
            <p>You should be aware of two issues with using <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>PageDown</kbd>: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first arises when the user is within a tabbed interface control on a Web   page. Here they can not easily switch browser tabs without first moving focus   outside of the tabbed interface control. This may be acceptable. </li>
              <li>The second   arises when the entire web page is a tabbed interface control. In this case the   user could not switch browser tabs unless the control on the web page ignored   the <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>PageDown</kbd> keypress (and thus letting the browser access it) when   the first or last tab was reached. </li>

              <li>The accordion component must have a role of <a href="#tablist" class="role-reference">tablist</a> and have   <a href="#aria-multiselectable" class="property-reference">aria-multiselectable</a>=&quot;true&quot; This will enable an assistive technology, such as   screen reader, to convey that the tablist is an accordion or a multiselectable   tablist. This will also tell the user that the keyboard navigation matches an   accordion and not a tablist. </li>
              <li>Contained within the tablist is a set of tab/tabpanel pairs. </li>
              <li>Each header tab in the tablist has a role of <a href="#tablist" class="role-reference">tab</a>. </li>
              <li>The accordion panel uses the role <a href="#tabpanel" class="role-reference">tabpanel</a> and should have an   <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference">aria-labelledby</a> relationship referencing the correponding header having a role   of <a href="#tablist" class="role-reference">tab</a></li>

            <p>An <a class="role-reference" href="#alert">alert</a> is an element that displays a brief, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting the user's task. Dynamically rendered alerts are automatically announced by most screen readers, and in some operating systems, they may trigger an alert sound. It is important to note that, at this time, screen readers do not inform users of alerts that are present on the page before page load completes.</p>
<p>Because an alert is intended to provide important and potentially time-sensitive information without interfering with the user's ability to continue working, authors should ensure alerts do not affect the keyboard focus. 
If there is a need to interrupt work flow, consider using an <a href="#alertdialog">alert dialog</a></p>
<p>In most circumstances, authors should avoid making alerts disappear automatically. 
An alert that disappears too quickly can lead to failure to meet <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-no-exceptions.html">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.3</a>. 
In addition, authors should be careful to avoid overuse of alerts. 
Frequent interruptions inhibit usability for people with visual and cognitive disabilities, leading to failures to meet <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-postponed.html">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.4</a>.</p>

The textbox value is not modified when the mouse is used to highlight a choice. Clicking on the highlighted choice will close the drop-down and update the textbox with the selected choice. This mimics the behavior of the HTML select element. </li>
                <li>With focus in an empty textbox, type <strong>any letter</strong>. If any of   the available choices begin with the letter typed, those choices are displayed   in a drop down.

                    <li>Until the user   presses the arrow keys to highlight a particular choice, only the typed letters   are displayed in the textbox. </li>
                    <li>In an editable auto-complete, if no   choices match the letter(s) typed, the drop down list closes. </li>

                    <li>Navigation through the list of choices and display of the   highlighted choice in the textbox works as described above.<br />
                      <em>Optional:   When a choice is highlighted via arrow key navigation, the input cursor is left   at the end of the typed entry and the highlighted choice is displayed in the   textbox with the characters after the input cursor selected. Typing an   additional character will remove the auto-completed portion and append the newly   typed character to the end of the previously typed characters.

                    <li>For an editable autocomplete that has text in the textbox that was both   typed by the user and auto-completed by highlighting a choice using the   keyboard, the auto-completed portion of the text is cleared and the user typed   characters remain in the textbox. The drop-down list is closed. To completely   clear the textbox contents the user must use the backspace key to remove the   typed characters. This is how the Google search box in the Firefox UI works. <em>Recommend that  pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key again   completely clears the textbox rather than relying on only the backspace   key.</em> </li>
                    <li>For a non-editable auto-complete that has text in the textbox that was both   typed by the user and auto-completed by highlighting a choice using the   keyboard, pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> closes the drop-down list and leaves the current   choice in the textbox. </li>
                    <li>For an editable or non-editable auto complete with text in the textbox that   was typed by the user and the mouse is highlighting a choice in the drop down   (keyboard navigation was NOT used), pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd> closes the drop down and   leaves the typed text displayed in the text box. Need to consider if pressing   <kbd>Escape</kbd> again should clear the typed text. The user must press the <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow or   <kbd>Alt+Down</kbd> arrow or click the associated icon to invoke the drop-down list of   choices again. </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Moving focus out of an empty auto complete field where a value is required   should either invoke an error or if a default value was initially assigned,   reset the value to the default value. </li>
                <li>Moving focus out of an auto complete field that does not contain a valid   entry should either invoke an error or if a default value was initially   assigned, reset the value to the default value. </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="note">It is good practice to limit the number of matching   items in the drop down to a reasonable number. The reasonable number is   determined by the task at hand. A list of the 50 US States is probably   reasonable, but a list containing all of the office numbers in a building is   probably not appropriate. </p>

              <p>A <a class="role-reference" href="#button">button</a> is a widget that enables users to trigger an action or event, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, cancelling an action, or performing a delete operation. A common convention for informing users that a button launches a dialog is to append &quot;&#8230;&quot; (ellipsis) to the button label, e.g., .&quot;Save as &#8230;&quot;.</p>
			  <p>In addition to the ordinary button widget, WAI-ARIA supports 2 other types of buttons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Toggle button: A two-state button that can be either off (not
                  pressed) or on (pressed). To tell assistive technologies that a button is
                  a toggle button, specify a value for the attribute <a
                  href="#aria-pressed" class="state-reference"
                >aria-pressed</a>. For example, a button labeled mute in an audio player
                  could indicate that sound is muted by setting the pressed state true. <strong>Important:</strong>
                      the label on a toggle button should never change when the state
                      changes. In this example, when the pressed state is true, the label
                      should not change to &quot;Unmute"&quot; or &quot;Muted.&quot; 
                </li>
                <li>Menu button: as described in the <a href="#menubutton">menu
                    button pattern</a>, a button will be revealed to assistive technologies as
                  a menu button if it has the property <a href="#aria-haspopup" class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</a> set true.
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p class="note">The types of actions performed by buttons are distinctly
                different from the function of a link (see <a href="#link">link pattern</a>). It is important that the
                role of a widget matches the function it provides. Ideally, the
                role of the element also matches its visual appearance. But, occasionally an
                element may be visually styled as an icon or link but perform the action of a button.
                In these cases, the element should be given a button role. The Designers
                should work to avoid conflicts between visual appearance and WAI-ARIA
                semantics.</p>

            <td class="widget-keyboard"><p>With focus on the button, pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key activates the button. Focus should behave appropriately for the type of action being performed. For example: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>If activating the button opens a dialog, the focus moves inside
                  the dialog. (see <a href="#dialog_nonmodal">dialog pattern</a>)</li>
                <li>If activating the button closes a dialog, typically focus should
                  return to the button that opened the dialog unless the function performed
                  in the dialog context logically leads to a different element. For
                  example, activating a cancel button in a dialog should always return
                  focus to the button that opened the dialog. However, if the dialog is
                  confirming a delete action that deletes the page from which it was
                  opened, the focus must logically move to a new context.</li>
                <li>If activating the button does not dismiss the current context,
                  then focus should typically remain on the button after activation, e.g.,
                  an Apply or Recalculate button.</li>
				<li>If the button action indicates a context change, such as move to next step in a wizard or add another search criteria, then it may be appropriate to move focus to the starting point for that action.</li> 			  
                <li>If the button is activated with a shortcut key, the focus should
                  usually remain in the context from which the shortcut key was activated.
                  For example, if <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> were assigned to an
                  &quot;Up&quot; button that moves the currently focused item in a list
                  one position higher in the list, pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd> when the
                  focus is in the list should not move the focus from the list.

                WAI-ARIA supports two types of <a href="#checkbox" class="role-reference">checkbox</a>
                widgets:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Dual-state: The most common type of checkbox, it allows the user
                  to toggle between two choices -- checked and not checked.</li>
                <li>Tri-state: This type of checkbox supports an additional third
                  state known as partially checked.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>One common use of a tri-state checkbox can be found in software installers 
              where a single tri-state checkbox is used to represent and control the state of an entire group of install options. 
              And, each option in the group can be individually turned on or off with a dual state checkbox.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If all options in the group are checked, the overall state is                  represented by the tri-state checkbox displaying as checked .</li>
                <li>If some of the options in the group are checked, the overall state is represented with the tri-state checkbox displaying as partially checked.</li>
                <li>If none of the options in the group are checked, the overall state of the group is represented with the tri-state checkbox displaying as not checked.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The user can use the tri-state checkbox to change all options in the
                group with a single action:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Checking the overall checkbox checks all options in the group.</li>
                <li>Unchecking the overall checkbox unchecks all options in the
                  group.</li>
                <li>And, In some implementations, the system may remember which
                  options were checked the last time the overall status was partially
                  checked. If this feature is provided, activating the overall checkbox a
                  third time recreates that partially checked state where only some
                  options in the group are checked.</li>

            <p>A combobox can be implemented using either of two design patterns:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>As a combination of text field, which may be editable, a displayable list of items, and a drop button   to toggle the display of that list; all   wrapped in the form of a single widget with role of combobox. </li>
              <li>As a combobox, which behaves like a textfield and may be editable, with a displayable list of items, and a drop button to toggle the display of that list;  </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Like text fields a combobox should be   labeled to convey the purpose of the widget. Keyboard focus within the widget   must be managed by the widget. Comboboxes are used extensively in graphical user   interfaces and the design pattern for the widget should be semantically correct. </p>
            <p>For the first combobox design pattern: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The container element that wraps the combobox has a role of <a href="#combobox" class="role-reference">combobox</a>. </li>
              <li>The first element within the combobox is an <code>input</code> text field and is   responsible for managing the keyboard focus between the text field and the list   as well as displaying the list. The text field is in the tab order. If   you create a text field without using a standard HTML text field form control then  ensure that it is in the tab order. </li>
              <li>If the text field is not editable it must have have <a href="#aria-readonly" class="property-reference">aria-readonly</a> = <code>true</code>. </li>
              <li>The combobox must have <a href="#aria-expanded" class="property-reference">aria-expanded</a> = <code>true</code> if the list is displayed or <a href="#aria-expanded" class="property-reference">aria-expanded</a> = <code>false</code> when it is not. </li>
              <li>The next element is an html <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, or another element with a role of <a href="#button" class="role-reference">button</a>.  This element is used to toggle the display of the combobox's drop down list. </li>
              <li>The next element has a <a href="#listbox" class="role-reference">listbox</a> role and represents the drop down   list.  It manages keyboard navigation among list items and  navigating back to the text field if necessary. </li>
              <li>Each item in the listbox is an <a href="#option" class="role-reference">option</a>. Options are not   in the tab order. </li>
              <li>Provide a label for the combobox by referencing the   text field in the combobox. You can use an <a href="#aria-label" class="property-reference">aria-label</a> to associate this label   with the combobox or you may use the HTML <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element and its <code>for</code>   attribute to reference the text field. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the second combobox design pattern: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The first element for the combobox has a role of combobox and behaves like an input text field and is responsible for managing the keyboard focus between the combobox and the list as well as displaying the list. The text field is in the tab order. If you create a text field without using a standard HTML text field form control then ensure that it is in the tab order.  </li>
              <li>If the combobox is not editable it must have have <a href="#aria-readonly" class="property-reference">aria-readonly</a> = <code>true</code> . </li>
              <li>The combobox must have <a href="#aria-expanded" class="property-reference">aria-expanded</a> = <code>true</code> if the list is displayed or <a href="#aria-expanded" class="property-reference">aria-expanded</a> = <code>false</code> when it is not. </li>
              <li>The next element is an html <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, or another element with a role of <a href="#button" class="role-reference">button</a>.  This element is used to toggle the display of the combobox's drop down list. </li>
              <li>The next element has a <a href="#listbox" class="role-reference">listbox</a> role and represents the drop down   list.  It manages keyboard navigation among list items and  navigating back to the text field if necessary. </li>
              <li>Each item in the listbox is an <a href="#option" class="role-reference">option</a>. Options are not   in the tab order. </li>
              <li>Provide a label for the combobox by referencing the   text field in the combobox.

            </ul>         
            <p>For each combobox pattern the button <em>need not</em> be in the tab order <em>if</em> there is an appropriate keystroke associated with the <code>input</code> element such that when focus is on the <code>input</code>, the keystroke triggers display of the associated drop down list. In this case, a <kbd>Tab</kbd> to focus the button is unnecessary. This is the same behavior as the <code>select</code> element. </p>

      widget allows the user to select a date or date ranges.
        The DatePicker shows one month at least. All navigation that is described
        below depends on the application. If no range selection is possible, the relevant keystroke interaction
        can be ignored. Also navigation to the past might be optional. Each week might be
        labeled with the corresponding calendar week number.
      <p>
      As a general rule the actual calendar portion of the date picker follows a table
      structure where days of the week and calendar day numbers are layed out in table cells. This
      provides context so an assistive technology can render the day of the week; its corresponding
      numeric calendar day, and week number if necessary. Consequently, it is best to start
      with an HTML table and apply WAI-ARIA semantics for a grid. However, should the author
      wish to uses a div or span to represent the cells then the DOM structure for a table is
      duplicated with rows marked with <code>role="<a href="#row" class="role-reference">row</a></code>."

              <li><kbd>Tab</kbd> Focus must be held within the dialog until it is   cancelled or submitted.

          <td class="widget-description"><p>Unlike an HTML table, which is display only, a grid presents tabular data in   rows and columns that are navigable via the keyboard, and allows for cells to   be selected in the grid. The user moves focus through each data cell having a   role of gridcell, through the use of arrow keys. Each column has an associated   element with the role columnheader. Data cells carry the role gridcell. A grid   may also contain hierarchical rows. In this case the role of the grid container   should be treegrid rather than grid. This design pattern, and corresponding examples, reflect a basic two-dimensional grid without grids embedded within a gridcell. </p>
            <p>WAI-ARIA grids are not meant to replace the full functionality of a table. Consequently, there may be instances when you need to have cells span multiple columns or rows for which WAI-ARIA does not provide semantics. This can be achieved by overlaying grid and gridcell semantics onto  an HTML table to provide appropriate column and row span semantics. Authors should ensure that headers are properly marked using a native header tag or WAI-ARIA columnheader or rowheader semantics. The connection between gridcell and header can be achieved using standard HTML attribute header. In HTML, multiple column or row headers for one data cell can be identified through the use of a space separated list of header ids in the headers attribute. </p>
            <p>If a WAI-ARIA grid is not overlayed on a table, authors should mark the rowheader, columnheader, and gridcell roles on the appropriate elements. For gridcells that span multiple columns or have multiple headers, the author should apply the aria-labelledby property to the cell to the space delimited list of corresponding row or column header element IDs. Gridcells that span multiple rows or columns should be reflected in the keyboard navigation.</p>

In this mode each tabbable object in each cell of the grid can be reached with the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. If multiple   tabbable items are located inside a single grid cell, <kbd>Tab</kbd> stops at each   one. When the last tabbable item in a cell is reached the next <kbd>Tab</kbd> moves to   the next tabbable item in the grid, wrapping at the last tabbable item in the   grid.</li>
              <li><kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> moves to the previous actionable (tabbable) item   in the grid and stays within the grid, wrapping at the top. </li>
              <li><kbd>Escape</kbd> exits Actionable mode (by which the user may enter text or perform an action to complete a operation) and returns to Navigation Mode (where the user is allowed to move focus among elements). If a widget is in the current grid cell that also uses the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key, then it should cancel the event propagation. A subsequent press of the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key returns focus to the parent widget.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Option</em>: the author may choose to enable 'auto action' on a cell in order to avoid having to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>F2</kbd> a second time to activate the default behavior of the object contained in a cell. For example, if the cell contains a single link the author may want to have enter follow the link rather than just move focus to it. This auto action mode should be configurable on a per cell basis as its utility is dependent on each cell's content. For example, if the cell contains multiple links, auto action should be disabled as its behavior would be ambiguous.   </p>
            <p><em>Option</em>: the author may choose to implement <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>F2</kbd> as a toggle such that pressing these keys multiple times will enter and exit actionable mode. Opinion was divided on this point. Some thought this would be confusing while others found it intuitive. </p>

            <p>A <a href="#listbox" class="role-reference">listbox</a> widget allows a user to select one or more items from a   list of choices or options.
            A listbox that allows a single option to be chosen is a single-select listbox; one that allows multiple options to be selected is a multi-select listbox.</p>
<p>The options in a WAI-ARIA listbox are static. That is, a listbox widget is not designed to contain a list of interactive elements, such as links, buttons, or sliders. 
This is because browser accessibility APIs do not support child elements contained inside the list options; they provide assistive technologies only with an accessible name, which is a plain text string,  and a selection state for each option. 
</p>
<p>When a screen reader user navigates the options in a list box, each static option name is spoken by the screen reader is a single piece of information. For this reason, authors should avoid creating options with very long names that contain more information than can be easily understood when spoken as a single unit of speech. Most screen reader users will not have a simple way of re-reading through the option name by character, word, or phrase if they did not understand it. See the examples for recommended ways of designing around this limitation. (Editor's note: examples are not yet coded.)</p>
<p>Authors should also avoid creating a large number of consecutive options that all start with the same word or phrase. Otherwise, finding a specific option can be very time consuming for a screen reader user who must listen to the repeated word or phrase while scrolling through the list. For example, if a listbox contains a list of cities where each option includes both city name and country name, and if there are 5 or more cities from each country, it would be very difficult for a screen reader user to find a city within a country if the country name precedes the city name in each option. In most cases, it would be better to have 2 list boxes, one for country and one for city, but where that is not feasible, it would typically be better to put the city name first in each option.</p>

             <p>A menu is a type of widget that offers a list of choices to the user. A menu is often a list of common actions or functions that the user can invoke. The menu role is appropriate when a list of menu items is presented in a manner similar to a menu on a desktop application. </p>
			 <p>A menubar is a presentation of a menu that usually remains visible and is usually presented horizontally.
             The menubar role is used to create a menu bar similar to those found in Windows, Mac, and Gnome desktop applications. A menu bar is used to create a consistent set of frequently used commands.</p>
			 <p>A menu or menubar should manage the focus of its descendants. </p>
             <p>Sometimes a menu item will launch a dialog box.  This is indicated using &quot;&#8230;&quot; (ellipsis) at the end of the menu item label.  An example is &quot;Save as &#8230;&quot;.</p>

            <li>Grouping of menuitems in a <a href="#menu" class="role-reference">menu</a> or <a href="#menubar" class="role-reference">menubar</a> is performed by introducing an element with the role of <a href="#separator" class="role-reference">separator</a>. A <a href="#separator" class="role-reference">separator</a> delineates groups of menu items within a <a href="#menu" class="role-reference">menu</a> or <a href="#menubar" class="role-reference">menubar</a>. A <a href="#separator" class="role-reference">separator</a> is not placed in the navigation order and it is in no way interactive. Authors provide an <a href="#aria-orientation" class="property-reference">aria-orientation</a> consistent with the separator's orientation in the menu or menubar. Since the separator is not navigable it does not support the <a href="#aria-expanded" class="state-reference">aria-expanded</a> state.

            <li>The browser should also provide a keyboard mechanism   for navigating into and out of the edit control. Within most browsers the edit   control is put into the tab order of the page and can be navigated into, out of,   and through using the tab and shift-tab keys like any standard form control. </li>
            <li>A rich text editor widget needs to provide a user   interface for interacting with the browser provided edit control. Interaction   between the user interface and editor is defined here assuming that a toolbar is   used. </li>
            <li><kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> - If not provided by the browser, the rich   text editor widget provides a keyboard mechanism to move into and out of the   edit control. Tab and shift-tab are the recommended keystrokes. The toolbar or   other user interface component associated with the editor is placed in the tab   order immediately before the editor. To set an attribute on text within the edit   control the user sets focus into the edit control, moves the insertion point,   selects text and presses shift-tab to move focus from the editor back to the   toolbar. The user navigates through the toolbar (see toolbar behavior) to a   desired attribute and invokes that attribute. When an attribute is invoked, that   attribute is applied to the selected text in the editor and focus moves back   into the editor at the previous insertion point with the selection intact. </li>
            <li><strong>Options:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Rather than using <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> to move focus from within the editor to the   toolbar, another key combination could be used (<kbd>Alt+Up</kbd> arrow, <kbd>Control+Shift+Letter</kbd>,   etc.). This would eliminate the need to put the user interface control (in this   example a toolbar) into the tab order immediately before the editor component.   However, there are drawbacks to using a different keystroke to navigate to the   user interface:
                    <ol>
                        <li>It is not as &quot;discoverable&quot; as relying on the standard <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>   behavior; </li>
                      <li>It is difficult to find key combinations which are not already captured by   the browser or assistive technology. </li>
                      <li>Focus could stay within the toolbar after the user invokes an attribute. The   user would then have to press an additional key to move focus back into the   editor. This would allow multiple attributes to be set on the current selection   without having to return back to the user interface but it would add an extra   key sequence after setting just a single attribute. Requiring a keystroke to   move focus back into the editor would also require modifying the toolbar   behavior to intercept this keystroke and to know how to set focus back to the   component (the editor) that the toolbar is associated with. </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>

            </ul>          
            <p>Optionally, if the developer wishes to provide the   ability to insert a tab into the document, it is recommended one of the   following methods be used.            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide indent and outdent buttons in the menu. Keyboard shortcuts to the   buttons should be <kbd>Control+M</kbd> for indent and <kbd>Control+Shift+M</kbd> for outdent. </li>
              <li>Provide a button in the menu to toggle the use of <kbd>Tab</kbd> between the two modes.   If this button is used, then <kbd>Control+M</kbd> is recommended as a   keyboard shortcut to toggle the button. </li>

            <p>A collection of links, buttons, or tabs, usually presented in a region on the left or top of a page, that is persistent across most pages of the site. It provides quick access to the primary sections or functions of the site. It may also communicate the structure or hierarchy of the site, allowing the user to quickly drill down to a desired page. It often provides orientation information similar to that of bread crumbs by indicating which page is currently displayed and what its relationship is to the other pages shown in the navigator. Some navigators are overloaded with support for other functions, e.g., reordering pages in a wiki.</p>
            <p>Multiple navigators may be present on a page. For example, there may be a top-level navigator presented as tabs across the top and a second level navigator presented as sub tabs either on the top or left.</p>
            <p>The site navigator patterns described in this guide are for interactive navigation widgets designed to help standardize solutions to accessibility requirements that have often either been ignored or implemented with other methods that are more limitted in their usefulness. For example, most site navigators implemented with static HTML provide a visual indicator of what page is currently displayed but few provide the same information programatically. Also, the static HTML navigators often provide information about page relationships through their visual layout that is not represented in their HTML structure. Finally, static HTML navigators require the user to tab to every element within the navigator whereas ARIA-enabled navigators implement arrow key navigation within the navigation widget. The navigator then becomes a single tab stop, dramatically reducing the length of the tab sequence and improving usability.</p>

          <td class="widget-aria">
            <p>An ARIA-enabled site navigator is made up of a container widget that enables interaction with the navigation items. The widget is wrapped in a navigation region. The requirements for the navigation widget, items, and region are as follows.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Navigation container widget: the navigation items need to be contained in an appropriate widget, such as a <a class="role-reference" href="#tree">tree</a>, <a class="role-reference" href="#menubar">menubar</a>, <a class="role-reference" href="#toolbar">toolbar</a>, or <a class="role-reference" href="#listbox">listbox</a>. See below for additional guidance on implementation using specific widget containers. If the navigator is for a hierarchical site or application, the hierarchy may be represented in one of two ways: by using a tree for the container widget or by using a separate widget for each level of the hierarchy. If a hierarchical site or application uses a tabbed navigation construct, it will need to use one of the patterns that implements a separate widget for each level of the hierarchy. The container widget implementation should address the following considerations and requirements.
                <ol>
                  <li>Label: The widget should be labelled by using <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-label">aria-label</a> or <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a>. The label should briefly and adequately describe the scope of navigation. For example, if the navigator scope is the entire site or application, the label could be set to the name of the site or application. Labels should normally be brief, e.g., one to three words. If multiple widgets are used to provide navigation of a hierarchy, the widget label for levels below the root widget should use <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a> to refer to the label of the item in the parent widget that represents the currently active navigation element.</li>
                  <li>Focus management: When the widget receives focus, the item in the widget that is currently active (e.g., currently displayed) should recieve the focus.</li>
                  <li><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a>: aria-controls should be set with a value that refers to the content region that is controlled by the navigator. If multiple navigators are used to provide navigation of a hierarchy, navigation widgets that change the elements of a child navigator should have aria-controls set with a value that refers to the controlled child navigation widget.</li>
                  <li><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-multiselectable">aria-multiselectable</a>: If the navigation widget is overloaded with non-navigation functions and if those functions can be performed on multiple elements, then the widget must support aria-multiselectable and have it set to <code>true</code>. </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Navigation items: each page or content container represented in the navigator should be represented by an element, such as an <a href="#option" class="role-reference">option</a>, <a class="role-reference" href="#treeitem">treeitem</a>, <a href="#menuitemradio" class="role-reference">menuitemradio</a>, or <a class="role-reference" href="#button">button</a>. If the navigator visually communicates which page is currently displayed, the navigation item must be able to programatically communicate the currently displayed status using <a href="#aria-selected" class="state-reference">aria-selected</a>, <a href="#aria-checked" class="state-reference">aria-checked</a>, or <a href="#aria-pressed" class="state-reference">aria-pressed</a>. For this reason, a navigation item may not be a link unless the link is contained inside an option or treeitem. The states and properties of the navigation item should communicate the following.
                <ol>
                  <li>Name of the target page or function: Every item must have an accessible name.</li>
                  <li>Current display status: The item representing the page that is currently displayed should have either <a href="#aria-selected" class="state-reference">aria-selected</a> or, if it is a <a class="role-reference" href="#button">button</a>, <a href="#aria-pressed" class="state-reference">aria-pressed</a> set to <code>true</code>. All other items in the widget must have the same state set to <code>false</code>. If the navigation widget is overloaded with non-navigation functions and if it supports multi-selection, then <a href="#aria-checked" class="state-reference">aria-checked</a> should be used instead of <a href="#aria-selected" class="state-reference">aria-selected</a> to indicate the display status.</li>
                  <li>Operational selection status: If the navigator is overloaded with non-navigation functions, each selected item must have <a href="#aria-selected" class="state-reference">aria-selected</a> set to <code>true</code> and each selectable item must have <a href="#aria-selected" class="state-reference">aria-selected</a> set to <code>false</code>.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Navigation region: Each navigation widget should be wrapped in a container with role <a class="role-reference" href="#navigation">navigation</a> and have a label that is the same as the label on the the widget. If multiple widgets are used to support a hierarchy and if the widgets are sequential in the <kbd>Tab</kbd> order, then the navigation regions for child widgets should be nested inside the navigation region of the parent.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The following two sections provide detailed descriptions of how to meet the above implementation requirements for site navigators using specific widgets. The <a href="#Site_Navigator_Tree">Site Navigator Tree</a> section describes how to build a hierarchical navigator using a tree widget that contains links. The <a href="#Site_Navigator_Tabbed_Style">Site Navigator Tabbed Style</a> section describes how to implement tabbed style site navigation using a toolbar containing toggle buttons, a menubar containing menuitemradio elements, or a listbox containing links. These are provided as examples and are not necessarily the only implementation options that can meet all the requirements described in this section.</p>

For example, a tree-based navigator is appropriate for the typical left-hand web site navigator that has an outline-like structure where activating a link displays the target of that link in the main content area and displays the pages that are children of the current page in the navigator. Unlike the typical static left-hand navigator, a dynamic tree widget could also provide the ability for the user to explore the hierarchy of the site without having to load a parent page in order to see the titles of the children. This would improve the navigation efficiency for all users by reducing the number of page loads.</p>

              <td class="widget-description"><p>A tabbed interface component is a container for resources associated with a tab. It is a set of layered pages where only one page is displayed at a time. The general look is similar to a file folder with a "tab" that contains the title of the folder. The tabs are arranged along one of the edges of the contents but most commonly are found at the top of the page. The user navigates and makes the contents of each page visible by interacting with the title "tab" of the page. Sometimes referred to as a tab container or tab panel. Terms for understanding Tab Panels include:</p>
                <dl>
                  <dt>tabbed interface component</dt>
                  <dd> a set of tabs and associated tab panels </dd>
                  <dt>tab panel</dt>
                  <dd>contents area that is associated with a tab</dd>
                  <dt>tab</dt>
                  <dd>the label/title area of the tab panel. This is where you click to activate a tab panel </dd>
                  <dt>tablist</dt>
                  <dd>the set of tabs</dd>
                </dl>
                <p>When the user activates a tab, the contents of the corresponding tab panel is made visible. The tab is considered "active". The tab remains active until another tab is activated. The active tab is placed into the tab order. Only the active tab should be in the tab order. A default tab is specified that is active when the tabbed interface component is initialized. A collection of tabs and their associated tab panels is a complex widget, because it performs show/hide actions as well as moving the user's point of regard around within the content. </p></td>

              <td class="widget-keyboard"><ul>
                  <li><kbd>Tab</kbd> - only the active tab is in the tab order. The user reaches the tabbed  panel component by pressing the tab key until the active tab title  receives focus. </li>
                  <li><kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> - with focus on a tab, pressing the left arrow will move focus to the  previous tab in the tab list and activate that tab. Pressing the left  arrow when the focus is on the first tab in the tab list will move  focus and activate the last tab in the list. </li>
                  <li><kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> - with focus on a tab, pressing the right arrow will move focus to the  next tab in the tab list and activate that tab. Pressing the right  arrow when the focus is on the last tab in the tab list will move focus  to and activate the first tab in the list. </li>
                  <li><kbd>Up arrow</kbd> - behaves the same as left arrow in order to support vertical tabs </li>
                  <li><kbd>Down arrow</kbd> - behaves the same as right arrow in order to support vertical tabs </li>
                  <li><kbd>Control+Up Arrow</kbd> - with focus anywhere within the tab panel, pressing <kbd>Control+Up Arrow</kbd>  will  move focus to the tab for that panel. This is not standard behavior -  is this something we want to implement? Is it necessary if we provide a  mechanism to change the active tab? Similar to  <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> in  Firefox to switch tabs? </li>
                  <li><kbd>Alt+Delete</kbd> - When deletion is allowed, with focus anywhere within the tab panel,  pressing <kbd>Alt+Delete</kbd> will delete the current tab and tab panel from the  tabbed interface control. If additional tabs remain in the tabbed  interface, focus goes to the next tab in the tab list. An alternative  to providing a keystroke to close a tab is to provide a context menu  that is associated with the tab title. When focus is on the tab,  pressing <kbd>Shift+F10</kbd> or pressing the right mouse button will open a  context menu with the close choice </li>
                  <li><kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd> - When focus is inside of a tab panel, pressing <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd> moves focus  to the tab of the previous tab in the tab list and activates that tab.  When focus is in the first tab panel in the tab list, pressing  <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd> will move focus to the last tab in the tab list and  activate that tab. </li>
                  <li><kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> When focus is inside of a tab panel, pressing <kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> moves  focus to the tab of the next tab in the tab list and activates that  tab. When focus is in the last tab panel in the tab list, pressing  <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>will move focus to the first tab in the tab list and  activate that tab. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Regarding <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd>. This is currently implemented in Firefox to move  between browser tabs. Firefox also supports <kbd>Control+Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Control+Shift+Tab</kbd>  to move between tabs. Internet Explorer 7 also uses <kbd>Control+Tab</kbd> and  <kbd>Control+Shift+Tab</kbd>. There may be advantages to using <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> as the keys to change tabs since it is a recognizable keystroke to at  least Firefox users and is also supported by the Windows operating  system to move between panels in a tabbed dialog. The problem is that  if the user is within a tabbed interface control on a Web page, they  can not easily switch browser tabs without first moving focus outside  of the tabbed interface control. This may be acceptable. The other  issue is if the entire Web page is a tabbed interface control - in that  case the user could not ever switch browser tabs unless the control on  the Web page ignored the <kbd>Control+PageUp</kbd>/<kbd>Control+PageDown</kbd> keypress (and thus  letting the browser access it) when the first or last tab was reached. </p></td>

When creating toolbars try to limit the number of items to approximately seven, as forcing users to navigate through an excessive number of items is a usability concern.

						<p>A tree view is a component to navigate hierarchical lists. It is made up
						of one or more top level nodes. A node may have children or it may be
						an end node. Nodes with children can be expanded or collapsed - when
						expanded its child nodes are visible. When collapsed the children are
						not visible. There is generally some sort of visual indication whether
						a node has children and can be expanded. Any number of nodes can be
						expanded at a time and child nodes may contain children. </p>
						<p>An example of a Tree View is a File Navigator where a tree view is used to navigate the directories and files on a
						file system. The directory nodes can be expanded and collapsed to
						reveal its contained subdirectories and files. Terms for understanding
						tree views include:</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>node</dt>
							<dd>An item in a tree. </dd>
							<dt>parent node</dt>
							<dd>Node with children. It can be opened / expanded or closed / collapsed </dd>
							<dt>open node</dt>
							<dd>Expanded node with children; first-level children are visible. </dd>
							<dt>closed node</dt>
							<dd>Closed node with children; the children are not visible. </dd>
							<dt>end node</dt>
							<dd>Node with no children </dd>
						</dl>
						<p>General behavior for tree views follows:</p>
						<ul>
								<li>On first load of the tree component, the top level node is in the tab order. </li>
							<li>One and only one node of the tree component is in the tab order of the page at any time. </li>
							<li>The last visited node in the tree control is retained in the tab order when the user navigates away from the tree control. </li>
							<li>Nodes can be focused and/or selected. There must be visual distinction between focused and selected nodes. </li>
							<li>Arrowing
								to an item with the keyboard or clicking on an item with the mouse will
								focus and select the node. Any previous selections are cleared </li>

  <h2> General Steps for Building an Accessible Widget with WAI-ARIA</h2>
  <p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from APG version 1.0 -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
  <p>At this point you should have a basic understanding of how WAI-ARIA is used to support interoperability with assistive technologies. If you are not reusing a WAI-ARIA-enabled widget library and wish to create your own the following steps will guide you through the thought process for creating an accessible widget using WAI-ARIA. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Pick the widget type (role) from the WAI-ARIA taxonomy</strong></p>
      <p>WAI-ARIA provides a <a href="#roles" class="specref">role taxonomy</a> ([[WAI-ARIA]], Section 3.4) constituting  the most common UI component types. Choose the role type from the provided table. If your desire was to create a toolbar set the role to toolbar:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="toolbar"&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>From the role, get the list of supported states and properties</strong>
      <p> Once you have chosen the role of your widget, consult the [[WAI-ARIA]] for an in-depth definition for the role to find the supported states, properties, and other attributes. For example, the <a class="role-reference" href="#toolbar">toolbar</a> role definition includes:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>superclass role</dt>
        <dd>In the taxonomy the widget you selected inherits states and properties from this role. In the case of a toolbar you will see that a toolbar is a subclass of a <a class="role-reference" href="#group">group</a>. This makes sense given that a toolbar is a collection of commonly used functions.</dd>
        <dt>related concept</dt>
        <dd>This is really more informative to state what other concepts are similar to this role. These may exist in different host languages outside WAI-ARIA. 
          The keyboard model 
          for the control should emulate that of the related concept control. </dd>
        <dt>supported states and properties</dt>
        <dd>These are unique states and properties that this widget supports and that were not inherited from its ancestors in the taxonomy. In the case of a <a class="role-reference" href="#toolbar">toolbar</a> there are no such states or properties. However, in the case of a <a class="role-reference" href="#listbox">listbox</a>, you may choose to set the property of <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-multiselectable">aria-multiselectable</a> to true if you were to have more than one item in the <a class="role-reference" href="#listitem">listitem</a> selected at a time.  This indicates to the assistive technology that the <a class="role-reference" href="#listbox">listbox</a> manages a collection of selectable options.</dd>
        <dt>inherited states and properties</dt>
        <dd>These are all the states and properties which are inherited from the roles's ancestors and which you may use. </dd>
        <dt>global states and properties</dt>
        <dd>These are states and properties which apply to all host language components regardless of whether a role is set or not. You may use these as well. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Once you have chosen the states and properties that apply to your widget you must set those properties you will use to set their initial values. Note: You do not need to use all the states and properties available for your role. In our case we shall use:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="toolbar" id="customToolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1"
      onkeydown="return optionKeyEvent(event);"
      onkeypress="return optionKeyEvent(event);"
      onblur="hideFocus();"
      onfocus="showFocus();"
      &gt; 
      &lt;img src="img/btn1.gif" title="Home" alt="Home" role="button" id=&quot;button1&quot;
           onclick="updateText('Home was invoked');"&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/btn2.gif" title="Refresh" alt="Refresh" role="button" id=&quot;button2&quot;
           onclick="updateText('Refresh was invoked');"&gt;
      &lt;img src="img/btn3.gif" title="Help" alt="Help" role="button" id=&quot;button3&quot;
           onclick="updateText('Help was invoked');"&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;  
</pre>
      <p>By setting tabindex=0 on the toolbar, the toolbar will receive focus in the document order. It is necessary then to use script and the aria-activedescendant property to manage virtual focus among the buttons. The details are given in step five, below.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <p>Important: When embedding WAI-ARIA markup in (X) HTML, all WAI-ARIA states and properties must be preceded with the characters <code>aria-</code> with the exception of the <code>role</code> and <code>tabindex</code> attributes. Otherwise, the user agent will not map the WAI-ARIA information, resulting in it not being  recognized by assistive technologies. </p>
        <p>When embedding WAI-ARIA into other host languages, <code>tabindex</code> does not carry over. The WAI-ARIA <code>tabindex</code> extensions are specific to (X)HTML to repair deficiencies in keyboard support. </p>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Establish the widget structure in the markup (parent/child)</strong>
      <p>Assistive technologies are very dependent on the structure of widgets as well as general document structure. Structure provides context to the user. A toolbar is a collection of common functions made available to the user. Therefore, all functions you would like in the toolbar must  be contained within it. This can be determined by using the [[dom]] tree structure created by the browser when parsing the host language. By using the parent child relationship of the DOM, an assistive technology can determine all the related toolbar widgets associated with the toolbar. The toolbar widgets would be DOM children of the "toolbar" container. For our purposes we will define three image buttons for cut, copy, and paste.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="toolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1"&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;buttoncut.png&quot; alt=&quot;cut&quot; id=&quot;button1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;buttoncopy.png&quot; alt=&quot;copy&quot; id=&quot;button2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;buttonpaste.png&quot; alt=&quot;paste&quot; id=&quot;button3&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;  </pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Repeat steps 1-3 for the children of the parent</strong>
      <p>We now need to assign the roles and states for each of the children. However, we shall save the detailed navigation for step 5.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="toolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1"&gt;
  &lt;img src="buttoncut.png" alt="cut" role="button" id="button1"&gt;
  &lt;img src="buttoncopy.png" alt="copy" role="button" id="button2"&gt;
  &lt;img src="buttonpaste.png" alt="paste" role="button" id="button3"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
      <p>The process of setting roles and states may be a recursive procedure if the children themselves have children, such as in the case of an expandable/collapsible <a class="role-reference" href="#tree">tree</a> widget.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Establish keyboard navigation of the widget and plan for how it will be navigated to within the document</strong></p>
    	<p>It is very important that  your widget be keyboard accessible. In fact, there must be a keyboard equivalent for every mouse operation. Where possible you should refer to the <a href="#aria_ex">WAI-ARIA examples</a> in this guide for tips on how to implement keyboard navigation for your widget. If you find that an example is not provided, you should follow standard keyboard bindings for UI components such as those used for the <!--<a href="http://www.dinf.ne.jp/doc/english/Us_Eu/conf/csun_98/csun98_051_jfckeys95.htm">Java Foundation Classes for Windows 95/NT</a>-->Java Foundation Classes for Windows 95/NT.</p>
      <p class="ednote">Commented out link to conference paper, which a) was broken, and b) we should have more canonical references than conference papers for things like this.</p>
      <p>For our toolbar, we have chosen to have the toolbar manage the focus for its children and through the use of the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property. We have also chosen to have the toolbar receive focus based on the tab order by using <code>tabindex</code>. In order to use <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a>, each focusable descendant must have an assigned ID. </p>

    function optionKeyEvent(event)
      {
      var tb = event.target;
      var buttonid; 
  
      DOM_VK_ENTER = 13;
      // Partial sample code for processing arrow keys

      if (event.type == "keydown") {
         if (event.altKey) {
           return true;  // Browser should use this, the menu view doesn't need alt-modified keys

           tb.setAttribute("aria-activedescendant", buttonid); 
         }
         else if (event.keyCode == event.DOM_VK_LEFT) {
            // Change the active toolbar button to the one to the left (circular) by

            tb.setAttribute("aria-activedescendant", buttonid); 
         } 
         else {

         }
         return false;

      <p>The details of implementing keyboard navigation are described in <a href="#keyboard">Keyboard and Structural Navigation</a> section of this document.</p>
      <p class="note">You must also show the visual focus for each element that has focus. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Apply and  manage needed WAI-ARIA states in response to user input events</strong></p>
      <p>Similar to the processing of <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> in Step 5, as author you must set any additional WAI-ARIA states and properties on document elements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Synchronize the visual UI with accessibility states and properties for supporting user agents</strong></p>
      <p class="ednote">Thomas comment: is confusing that the example switches from toolbar to treeitem.  Maybe the best overall sample is to do a tree because it demonstrates each of the points you want to make? </p>
      <p>You should consider binding  user interface changes directly to changes in WAI-ARIA states and properties, such as through  the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/selector.html#attribute-selectors">CSS attribute selectors</a>. For example, the setting of the <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-selected">aria-selected</a> state may change the background of a selected <a class="role-reference" href="#treeitem">treeitem</a> in a <a class="role-reference" href="#tree">tree</a>. This may also be done with JavaScript.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
.treeitem[role="treeitem"][aria-selected="true"] {color: white; background-color: #222222;}

.treeitem[role="treeitem"][aria-selected="false"] {color: white; background-color: beige;}        </pre>
      <p>Authors should be aware that CSS attribute selectors are not supported in some browsers, such as Internet Explorer 6. A consistent way to apply styling to reflect WAI-ARIA semantics would be to assign an element a class name based on the WAI-ARIA attribute being set using script as shown here:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">function setSelectedOption(menuItem)
     {
        if (menuItem.getAttribute("role") != "menuitem") {
           return;
        }
        var menu = getMenu(menuItem);
        var oldMenuItem = getSelectedOption(menu);
        
        // Set class so that we show selection appearance
        oldMenuItem.className="unselected";
        menu.setAttribute("aria-activedescendant", menuItem.id);
        menuItem.className= "selected";
      }</pre>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Showing and Hiding Sections in a Widget</strong>
      <p> The proper synchronization of showing and hiding sections in a widget with the WAI-ARIA display state is also critical. Some platform accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> provide events for applications to notify the assistive technology when pop-ups such as menus, alerts, and dialogs come into view or go away. Rich Internet applications can assist browsers which support these conventions by: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p> Creating an entire section and then insert it into the [[dom]],  as a subtree of the parent element activated to show the pop-up,  and then removing the section from the inserted area when  the pop-up goes away.</p>
          <p>OR</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using the following style sheet properties to show and hide document sections being used to represent the pop-up items, menus or dialogs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>display:block</code></li>
            <li><code>display:none</code></li>
            <li><code>visibility:visible</code></li>
            <li><code>visibility:hidden</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>By monitoring these behaviors a user agent may use this information to notify assistive technology that the pop-up has occurred by generating the appropriate accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> event. </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Some assistive technologies may use the DOM directly to determine these when pop-up occurs. In this case, the first mechanism of writing a section to the DOM would work using the DOM events as demonstrated here. </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
	  // create new table row with table cell and div
	  var newTr = document.createElement('TR');
	  var newTd = document.createElement('TD');
	  var newDiv = document.createElement('DIV');
	  newTr.appendChild(newTd);
	  newTd.appendChild(newDiv);
	  
	  
	  //insert this new table row before the Node selected
	  var container = theNode.parentNode;
	  container.insertBefore(newTr, theNode);
	  
	  //remove theNode selected
	  container.removeChild(theNode);"</pre>
      <p>However, if you are using CSS to show and hide sections of the DOM (2) it is essential that you set the corresponding WAI-ARIA <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-hidden">aria-hidden</a> property to indicate that the section is visible or hidden and synchronize it with your CSS styling as shown here: </p>
      <pre class="example highlight">[aria-hidden=true] {visibility: hidden;}

&#8230;

&lt;div role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-owns="mypopupmenu"&gt;
&lt;div role="menu" aria-hidden="true" id="mypopupmenu"&gt;&#8230;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Support basic accessibility, such as alternative text on images</strong>
      <p>When an image is used to represent information within a component, such as  image buttons, you need to set the alternative text on those images. This is then mapped by the user agent to the accessible name in the platform accessibility API. Using our example:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="toolbar" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="button1" id="tb1" 
     onkeydown="return optionKeyEvent(event);"      
     onkeypress="return optionKeyEvent(event);"&gt;    
   &lt;img src="buttoncut" role="button" id="button1" alt="cut"&gt;
   &lt;img src="buttoncopy" role="button" id="button2" alt="copy"&gt;
   &lt;img src="buttonpaste" role="button" id="button3" alt="paste"&gt;      
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Establish WAI-ARIA relationships between this widget and others</strong>
      <p>Once you have made the basic widget accessible you may then need to establish its relationship to other widgets. Examples of this are <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a>, <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a>, <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-describedby">aria-describedby</a> and <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-flowto">aria-flowto</a>. The details of using these relationships are described in the <a href="#relations">Relationships</a> section of this document. </p>
      <p>Other relationships which should be considered are more declarative and provide context to the widget within a set. For these, <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-level">aria-level</a>, <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-posinset">aria-posinset</a>, and <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-setsize">aria-setsize</a> are provided. If you structure your Document Object Model appropriately so that the user agent can determine this information from it using the DOM hierarchy directly, you do not need to set these properties. There are, however, situations in rich internet applications where all the elements in a container are not in the DOM at one time, such as when you can only render the ten of fifty items in a subtree. In this case the user agent cannot determine the number of tree items (<a class="property-reference" href="#aria-setsize">aria-setsize</a>) for the position in the set (<a class="property-reference" href="#aria-posinset">aria-posinset</a>), and potentially the tree depth (<a class="property-reference" href="#aria-level">aria-level</a>) from the DOM. In these situations you will need to provide these WAI-ARIA properties.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Review widget to ensure that you have not hard coded sizes</strong></p>
      <p>The ability for applications to respond to system font settings is a requirement. Most user agents are designed to meet this requirement. This also means your Web application running within your browser is impacted when the user agent changes the font sizes to meet the need. If you have hard coded your font size in pixels  an increase in system fonts will not be reflected in your Web application. You must also not hard code the size of your widgets in pixels either. If the fonts are scalable, but the widget they are encapsulated in is not, then the text could flow outside your widget. </p>
<p>Follow these rules to allow your application to respond to system font settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a base set of font sizes used in widgets based on percentage of the container element font size.</li>
<li>Use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> width, borders, margin, padding, background, and positioning properties to specify the 		graphical rendering of widgets and their sub-components, use percentage units or em units to specify widths of widget components (An em is a  the font unit of measure between the top and bottom of an upper case letter M.). Border      widths, padding, and margins can use <abbr title="pixel">PX</abbr> units.</li>
<li>Use scripting for run time CSS positioning of widget sub-components in relation to other sub components.</li>
<li>Make sure all widgets use consistent height and width units of measure.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Percentages are the most reliable way to consistently specify proportional text sizes in widgets. The use of percentages and em should be used for specifying widths of a widget and the widget sub components. The use of percentages for text size and percentages and em units for widths support browser zoom capabilities to make widgets larger or smaller.

Pixels can be used for specifying line widths, padding and margins.</p>
      <p class="note"> <em>Important: Most browsers today have a zoom feature which allow the user to magnify the entire Web page. Most legislation today requires that your application respond to system font and color settings and therefore you will want to consider the fact the system settings could adversely affect your Web page should you decide to hard code pixel sizes.</em> </p>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Compensate for Background Images when in High Contrast Mode</strong>
      <p>Authors use background images when styling their widgets, including situations where the background image is not merely decorative, but informative.  An example is a horizontal progress bar that it is filled by gradually revealing more of a background image.  This is accomplished by initially setting the width of the element to zero, and then incrementing its width in accordance with the degree of progress.</p>
      <p><em>High contrast mode</em> is an operating system display modification that makes the screen easier to see for low vision users.  Some operating systems (e.g., Windows), do not display background images when in high contrast mode.  Consequently, the progress bar described above appears empty regardless of the progress.  It is recommended that authors not use background images as the sole method to convey important information, and to compensate with alternative or additional style rules. </p>
      <p>In the case of the progress bar example, a technique that works when in high contrast mode is to style the element with a border.  Since the width of the element is updated as progress increases, its border gradually expands horizontally forming an ever wider unfilled rectangle.  This provides alternative visual feedback as to the extent of the progress.</p>
      <p>Another technique is to replace a background image with text.  Consider a dialog that uses a background image for its close box.  To compensate for the missing close box when in high contrast mode, a lower case 'x' is used instead.  The compensation technique used depends on the context, particularly the purpose of the background image.</p>
      <p>There are two general approaches with respect to detecting high contrast mode.  They are (1) executing a script to determine if the system is in high contrast mode, or (2) providing a preference to use alternative styles.  The advantage of automatic detection is that some operating systems simply apply a different color palette when in high contrast mode and do not turn off background images.  In that case, authors need not compensate for missing background images.  However, detection of high contrast mode by script is relatively expensive compared to a preference that users can set, and, presumably, users can see whether background images are displayed in high contrast mode on their system.  It is up to individual authors to decide which method they find acceptable for their particular situation.</p>
      <p>The following code fragment outlines how to detect high contrast mode. </p>
      <pre>
/* Define styles for the high contrast test element */
#hiContrastTestEl {
    border: 1px solid;
    border-color:red green;
    position: absolute;
    height: 5px;
    top: -999px;
    background-image: url('resources/blank.gif');
}
&#8230;
// An onload event handler that inserts the high contrast test element and
// then tests its computed styles.
function detectHiContrast() {
    var div = document.createElement('div');
    div.setAttribute ('id', 'hiContrastTestEl');
    // &#8230; append &lt;div#hiContrastTestEl&gt; to the &lt;body&gt; element &#8230;
    var cs = window.getComputedStyle(div);
    var bki = cs.backgroundImage;
    var hiContrast = false;
    
    // The CSS sets the top and right borders of the test element to red and
    // green, respectively.  In high contrast mode either the borders are
    // the same colour, or there is no legitimate url to the background image.
    hiContrast =    (cs.borderTopColor == cs.borderRightColor) ||
                    (bki != null &amp;&amp; (bki == 'none' || bki == 'url (invalid-url:)'));
    
    if (hiContrast) {
        // apply hi contrast styles to compensate for missing background images.
    }
    // &#8230; remove the test element from the document &#8230;
}</pre>
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Test with User agent, Assistive Technology, and People with disabilities</strong>
      <p>To ensure you have set your WAI-ARIA semantics correctly, test your application with your user agent, an assistive technology, and a person with disability. Example assistive technologies are screen readers and screen magnifiers. Ensure that your user agent is designed to support WAI-ARIA and their your assistive technology is designed to support WAI-ARIA  in the selected user agent.</p>
      <p>Finding people with disabilities to do testing may be difficult but many companies employ people with disabilities, including your customers, and you should reach out to them to ask for help.

      <h4>WAI-ARIA Keyboard Bindings and Behaviors</h4>
      <p> Essential to accessible Web 2.0 widgets is keyboard support to provide full operation and functionality of a widget through keyboard-only events. Unlike traditional HTML form controls, Web 2.0 widgets, typically, have no inherent keyboard support. The developer must enable keyboard support for the widgets they create or use widget libraries with keyboard support. The model for keyboard support for Web 2.0 widgets are graphical user interface (GUI) operating systems like Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X; and other desktop operating systems like GNOME and GTK. Basic accessibility requirements for keyboard focus include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support users who cannot use pointing devices due to physical or visual impairment to access the full functionality of the Web application. </li>
        <li>All major software and Web accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities require keyboard-only operation of the interface for accessibility. </li>
        <li>Communicate accessibility information to assistive technologies on the type of widget and its associated state and properties. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, if a screen reader user hears a tree announced, they know that pressing the right arrow key will expand  a node. Similarly, when they hear a grid announced, they know they can use their screen reader's table reading commands. </p>

      <section id="kbd_general_between">
      <h4> Keyboard Navigation between Widgets (tabindex)</h4>
      <p> The <code>tabindex</code> attribute enables focus to be moved via keyboard to HTML elements. For standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/">HTML 4.01</a>, tabindex was limited to form and anchor elements. For WAI-ARIA, the <code>tabindex</code> attribute is now applicable to all renderable HTML elements with additional functionality designed to help the author produce keyboard accessible  Web 2.0 widgets. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> key move focus among widgets and standard HTML controls. </li>
        <li>Widgets with tabindex=0 will be added to the tab sequence based on document order </li>
        <li>Widgets with tabindex&gt;0 will be added to the tab sequence based on the TABINDEX value </li>
        <li>Widgets with tabindex&lt;0 will not be added to the tab sequence but are enabled to receive keyboard focus. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once a widget has keyboard focus, arrow keys, <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, or other keyboard commands can be used to navigate the options of the widget, change its state, or trigger an application function associated with the widget. </p>
    </section>
      <section id="kbd_general_within">
      <h4> Keyboard Navigation within Widgets</h4>
      <p> Each element that receives keyboard focus needs to have a <code>tabindex</code> attribute set to its current active descendant element and itself if an active descendant does not exist. The element with keyboard focus is essential because it communicates information about the widget to assistive technologies like screen readers and magnifiers through operating specific accessibility APIs like Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), the Apple AX APIs, and the ATK Accessibility Toolkit. The TAB key moves keyboard focus to the widget, and other keys operate the features of the widget, typically cursor keys, <kbd>Enter</kbd> key and <kbd>Space</kbd>. The actual keys are up to the developer, but best practices recommend using the same key bindings that are used to control similar widgets in common GUI operating systems like Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and other desktop operating systems like GNOME and GTK. </p>
      <p> Authors can use either the JavaScript <code>focus()</code> method to move focus to the appropriate element in the widget, or they can use a WAI-ARIA property called <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> on the actual widget container to indicate which descendant element in the widget has focus. Use the following procedure when focus is completely dependent on the use of tabindex to provide focus in a widget:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the current active descendant in the container widget while setting <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on all the other descendant elements of the widget.</li>
        <li>As the user navigates (e.g., arrows) away from an item, set <code>tabindex="-1"</code> on the old item, and <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the new.</li>
        <li>Use the JavaScript <code>focus()</code> method to put focus on the new item, whose <code>tabindex="0"</code>.</li>
      </ul>
        <p id="roving">This procedure creates a <em>roving</em> tabindex. If the user TAB navigates away and then TABs back to the widget, the same last active descendant becomes active again. This relieves the author from having to compute and set the focus to the last active descendant. </p>
      <p>Conversely, if you use the WAI-ARI <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set <code>tabindex="0"</code> on the element which is the composite widget, and set its <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property to the id of the descendant element you wish to be active,</li>
        <li>As the user navigates (e.g., arrows) away from an item in the widget, refresh the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property on the containing widget to the id of the new active descendant element. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this scenario, the browser manages focus changes; however, the author manages changes to the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property. For greater detail, see <a href="#focus_tabindex">Using Tabindex to Manage Focus Among Widgets</a>. In both scenarios authors indicate which element in the widget has focus or is active through styling and/or markup. </p>

    	<h4>Keyboard Shortcuts for Widgets</h4>
    	<p>It is useful to provide keyboard access to widgets, to focus a widget directly and to activate the features within the widget. These may be &quot;mnemonics&quot; that use a letter from the label of the control, as well as other special keys that perform familiar operations on the system. When providing non-standard key commands, document them so the user knows how to use them.</p>
    	<p>When localizing the user interface, it may be necessary to localize keyboard mnemonics as well in order to keep them apparent. Be sure not to introduce key conflicts when doing this, and ensure that the correct key commands remain apparent to the user.</p>

      <h4> Other Widget Authoring Practices</h4>
      <p>The <a href="#aria_ex_widget">Common Widget Design Patterns</a> section of this document contains best  practices, such as keyboard navigation, for creating common widgets found on the Web. This section contains miscellaneous authoring practices that you should also consider.</p>
        <section id="kbd_general_valuenow">
      <h5>Maintain a valid format for aria-valuenow</h5>
<p>
It is essential that application vendors maintain a valid format for
<a href="#aria-valuenow" class="property-reference">aria-valuenow</a>, and aria-valuenow should
accurately represent the value of the widget.The value must be within range of <a href="#aria-valuemax" class="property-reference">aria-valuemin</a> and <a href="#aria-valuemin" class="property-reference">aria-valuemin</a>, where the value of aria-valuemin is less than or equal to the value of aria-valuemax, throughout the life cycle of your widget. If aria-valuemin is not less than or equal to the value of aria-valuemax, or if the aria-valuemax is indeterminate, this creates an error condition that will be handled by 
the assistive technology, resulting in undesirable results. Should an alternative text
  equivalent be needed to properly represent the aria-valuenow, such as a day
  of the week, then you should accompany the aria-valuenow with an appropriate
  aria-valuetext equivalent such as in this example: </p>
<pre>
&lt;div role=&quot;slider&quot; aria-valuenow=&quot;1&quot; 
	aria-valuemin=&quot;1&quot; aria-valuemax=&quot;7&quot;
	aria-valuetext=&quot;Sunday&quot;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Here the values 1 through 7 represent the days of the week and
  aria-valuenow of 1 is equivalent to the first day of the week or Sunday.  When aria-valuetext is made available aria-valuenow should also be treated as an   index which is 1 based. </p>

    <h3> Providing Keyboard Focus</h3>
    <p>One way to provide keyboard support in (X)HTML is with form and list elements that accept keyboard focus by default. With the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, the user can navigate to these types of elements. However, when building sophisticated widgets, it's necessary to be able to control keyboard navigation exactly. Authors may require or prefer to use host language elements that do not have built-in keyboard navigation features. For example, the author may wish to provide keyboard navigation without altering the tab order. Navigating within large composite widgets such as tree views, menubars, and spreadsheets can be very tedious and is inconsistent with what users are familiar with in their desktop counterparts. The solution is to provide full keyboard support using the arrow keys to provide more intuitive navigation within the widget, while allowing Tab and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+Tab to move focus out of the widget to the next place in the tab order. </p>
<p> A tenet of keyboard accessibility is reliable, persistent indication of focus. The author is responsible, in the scripts, for maintaining visual and programmatic focus and observing accessible behavior rules. Screen readers and keyboard-only users rely on focus to operate rich internet applications with the keyboard. </p>
      <section id="focus_tabindex">
      <h4> Using Tabindex to Manage Focus among Widgets</h4>
      <p>One requirement for supporting the keyboard is to allow focus to be set to any element. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex" title="HTML4 tabindex attribute ">tabindex</a> attribute can be used to include additional elements in the tab order and to set programmatic focus to them. Originally implemented in Internet Explorer 5, the feature has been extended to Opera, Gecko-based user agents such as Firefox, and WebKit-based user agents such as Safari. The following table outlines the use of the tabindex attribute: </p>
      <div>
        <table>
          <caption>
          Use of the Tabindex Attribute
          </caption>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th>Tabindex Attribute</th>

            <tr>
              <td><p>not present</p></td>
              <td>Follows default behavior of element (only form controls and anchors can receive focus.)</td>
              <td>Follows default behavior of element</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><p>zero - tabindex="0"</p></td>

            </tr>

              <td>yes</td>
              <td>Tabindex value directly specifies where this element is positioned in the tab order.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><p>Negative - tabindex="-1"</p></td>
              <td>yes</td>
              <td>No, author must focus it with element.focus() as a result of arrow or other key press</td>

        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Setting a tabindex value of -1 to an element enables the element to receive focus via JavaScript using the element.focus() method. This method is used to enable arrow key navigation to elements. Each element that can be navigated to via arrow keys must have a tabindex of -1 to enable it to receive focus. Here are just a few additional tips  to help you with managing keyboard focus:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>
      		<p><em>Use focus and blur events (or event delegation) to monitor changes to the current focus</em> - <code>focus</code> and <code>blur</code> events can now be used with every element. Modern browsers now support an <code>activeElement</code> property on the document object to get the focused element. Don't assume that all focus changes will come via key and mouse events, because assistive technologies such as screen readers can set the focus to any focusable element, and that needs to be handled elegantly by the JavaScript widget. Techniques such as &quot;event delegation&quot; (for example, intercepting events on a list rather than on every listitem) can greatly increase web application performance and code maintainability, and authors are encouraged to use JavaScript best practices whenever possible. </p>
      		<p class="note">The <code>activeElement</code> property is now standard in HTML 5.</p>
      	</li>
        <li>
        	<p><em>Follow keydowns to move focus</em> - A keydown event handler can determine the next object to receive focus and call that element's focus() method. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<p><em>Use onkeydown to trap key events, not onkeypress</em> - Key press events do not fire for all keys and they vary across browsers. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<p><em>Dynamically change focusability using the tabIndex property</em> - You may want to update tabindex values if a custom control becomes disabled or enabled. Disabled controls should not be in the tab order. However, you can typically arrow to them if they're part of grouped navigation widget.  When an element receives focus, it should change the tabindex value to 0 to make an element the default element of the widget.  This is important if the user leaves the widget and returns to the widget again so focus is on the last element of the widget the user was on.  If other elements of a widget can receive keyboard focus, only one element of the widget should have a tabindex value of 0.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<p><em>Use element.focus() to set focus</em> - Do not use createEvent(), initEvent() and dispatchEvent() to send focus to an element, because these functions do not change the focus.  DOM focus events are informational only, generated by the user agent after an element has acquired focus, but not used themselves to set focus.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<p>The use of :focus pseudo-class selectors to style the keyboard focus is not supported in many versions of Internet Explorer. Authors should use the :active pseudo-class (which older versions of IE treat like :focus) in conjunction with the :focus pseudo-class. Example: a:focus, a:active { text-decoration: underline; } </p>
			<p>If the related CSS pseudo-classes are not appropriate or not supported in all browsers, authors can use JavaScript techniques to indicate an appropriate focus alternative, such as using focus and blur events to toggle a classname on an element.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
        	<p><em>Always draw the focus for tabindex="-1" items and elements that receive focus programmatically when supporting versions of Internet Explorer older than 8</em> - Choose between changing the background  color via something like this.style.backgroundColor = "gray"; or add a dotted border via this.style.border = "1px dotted invert".  In the dotted border case, you will need to make sure those elements  have an invisible 1px border to start with, so that the element doesn't  grow when the border style is applied (borders take up space, and IE  doesn't implement CSS outlines). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<p><em>Prevent used key events from performing browser functions</em> - If a key such as an arrow key is used, prevent the browser from using the key to do something (such as scrolling) by using code like the following:</p>
        	<pre class="example highlight">&lt;span tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; onkeypress=&quot;return  handleKeyPress();&quot;&gt; </pre>
        	<p>If handleKeyDown() returns false, the event will be consumed, preventing the browser from performing any action based on the keystroke.  In addition to the return value the browser must call the event methods that will prevent the default action, for IE this is setting the event property &quot;returnValue=false&quot;, and for other browsers supporting the W3C event model this means calling the &quot;preventDefault&quot; method of the event object.</p>
        	</li>
        <li>
        	<pre class="example highlight">&lt;span tabindex="-1" onkeydown="return handleKeyDown();"&gt;   </pre>
        	<p>If handleKeyDown() returns false, the event will be consumed, preventing the browser from performing any action based on the keystroke. </p>
        	</li>
        <li>
          	<p><em>Use key event handlers to enable activation of the element</em> - For every mouse event handler, a keyboard event handler is required. For example, if you have an <em>onclick="doSomething()"</em> you may also need <em>onkeydown="return event.keyCode != 13 || doSomething();" </em>in order to allow the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to activate that element. </p>

        </li>
        <li>
        	<p>Consider using a "<a href="#kbd_general_within">roving</a>" tabindex for complex widgets if you are not using the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property. </p>

      <section id="focus_activedescendant">
      <h4> Using activedescendant to Manage Focus for Widget Children</h4>
      <p>In addition to tabindex, WAI-ARIA provides  the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property  for managing the focus of child elements within a widget. Widgets like <a class="role-reference" href="#grid">grid</a> and <a class="role-reference" href="#tree">tree</a> typically manage their children. The root element of the widget should have a <code>tabindex</code> value greater than or equal to "0" to ensure that the widget is in the document tabbing order. Rather than setting a key event handler on each element within a larger component, the event handler can be set on the parent element such as the tree. It is then the job of the parent element to manage the focus of the children. </p>
      <p> The parent may use the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property to indicate the active child. For example, the container element with the role of tree can provide an onkeydown event handler so that each individual tree item within the tree does not need to be focusable and to listen for the keydown event. The container object, in this case the tree, needs to maintain the point of regard and manage which individual child item must be perceived as active.</p>
        <p class="note"><em>Important: For a given container widget where activedescendant must cause focus events to be fired to ATs, the actual focus must be on the container widget itself. In HTML this is done by putting tabindex="0" on the container widget.</em></p>
      <p>The key handler on the parent captures the keystrokes and determines what item becomes active next and updates the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property with the ID of the appropriate, next active child element. The browser takes that ID information and generates the focus event to the assistive technology. Each individual element does not have to be made focusable via a <code>tabindex</code> value of -1, but it must be styled using CSS to indicate the active status.</p>
      <p>As active status is moved to the next descendant, ensure that it is scrolled into view using <code>scrollIntoView()</code>.  See section <a href="#scrollintoview">Managing Focus with Scroll</a> below for more information.</p>
    </section>
      <section id="visualfocus">
      <h5>Managing Visual Focus with tabindex Alone </h5>
      <p>An alternative to using activedescendant is to have the parent element, in response to the same keyboard input, move focus to its children by first removing <code>tabindex</code> from children that do not have focus, which removes them from the tab order. This would be followed by setting the <code>tabindex</code> to "-1" on the element that is to receive focus and then using script to set focus on the element to receive focus. As with <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a>, this omits managed children from the tabbing order. It enables browsers that do not yet support <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> to maintain keyboard navigation, and it provides notification to many assistive technologies like screen magnifiers to move visual focus without relying on other WAI-ARIA properties. Today, this technique will work in most user agents, but in the long run <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> will require less work by the developer.</p>
      <p>Although not always ideal based on the widget you are creating, one benefit of using tabindex to manage focus on an element is that the user agent will scroll the element into view when focus is set to the it. This is not the case for <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a>. When setting or updating the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property, e.g. <code>aria-activedescendant="cell23"</code>, authors must ensure that the   element with <code>id="cell23"</code> is in view. In either case, consider positioning your widget in the visible area of your browser to maximize usability. This can be achieved using available JavaScript scrolling functions.</p>
    </section>
      <section id="scrollintoview">
      <h5>Managing Focus with Scroll</h5>
      <p>In some browsers, a JavaScript call to <code> scrollIntoView()</code> on this element should suffice, but in browsers where   this is unreliable, authors should explicitly set the <code>scrollTop</code> and <code>scrollLeft</code> properties of the "cell23" element and its ancestors to scroll the element into view. <code>scrollTop</code> and <code>scrollLeft</code> adjust the node positions by the amounts(pixels) needed to scroll a node into view.  Scrolling values are adjusted by the amounts(pixels) needed 
        to scroll a node into view. This is done by comparing the sizes of the nodes 
        using available measurements such as scroll+offset+clientWidth/Height/Left/Top. It's important to note that you have to adjust a node so that it's viewable within 
        the context of its parent node.  Then you have to move up the DOM tree and make 
        each parent node visible.</p>
      <p>For example, create a custom <code> scrollIntoView()</code> method that is called at various   times, including coincidence with the setting of the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-activedescendant">aria-activedescendant</a> property. The method takes a DOM node   argument, say "n". Here is the high level algorithm: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> If n is already in view, stop; otherwise, continue. </li>
        <li> adjust n.scrollTop and n.scrollLeft such that it is in view. </li>
        <li>adjust scrollTop and scrollLeft for the ancestor nodes of n such that   that the region of the ancestors which n consumes is visible.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is a minimum-position-change algorithm. </p>
      <p>Understanding how the DOM scrollIntoView works across browsers is important. 
        Browsers (including Firefox3) force the node either to the top or the bottom of the screen (as defined by the single Boolean parameter) even if its already in view. This is problematic when you only need to scroll horizontally to see the element. It is also problematic when  the node is partially off the bottom of the screen and the parameter is (true) which forces the node all the way to the top, and vice versa with the top going to the bottom on (false). IE forces the node to the left of the client area (or right in right-to-left mode) even if it's horizontally in view already. </p>
      <p>The <code>scrollTop</code> and<code> scrollLeft</code> functions create some challenges. <code>scrollTop</code> is always accurate but misleading with respect to inner (nested) scrollbars.<code> scrollLeft</code> cannot be relied on in right-to-left languages because it is sometimes negative and sometimes positive especially with respect to inner (nested) scrollbars. Different browsers handle right-to-left completely differently. </p>

    	<h4>Managing the Perception of a Dual Focus</h4>
    	<p>Often applications give the  perception of having a dual focus. Two examples of this are multi-selection list boxes and selected tabs, within a tablist, when focus is in a tabpanel. In the case of a muti-selection list box a developer may gray selected items as they move focus to list box items to toggle their selected state. In the case of a <span class="role-reference">tabpanel</span> the user selects a tab but then navigates to a focused item in the corresponding <span class="role-reference">tabpanel</span> the tab appears to also have focus. In reality, only one element may have focus in an application. In these scenarios authors should ensure keyboard focus is set on the current element that visibly receives keyboard user input while ensuring other &quot;highlighted&quot; elements have an aria-selected state of &quot;true&quot; until de-selected. When the de-selection occurs, such as when a multi-select item is de-selected or a user moves to a new tab and de-select the old tab, the author should ensure that the visible selection of the de-selected item is removed.</p>

      <h4> Author-Defined Keyboard Short-Cuts or Mnemonics </h4>
      <p>Author-defined keyboard short-cuts or mnemonics present a high risk for assistive technology users. Because they are device-, browser-, and AT-dependent, conflicts among key bindings are highly probable. Therefore, if you needed to use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2">accesskey</a>,  you should be aware that  it will behave differently in <br/>
        different browsers. It also may not work with small devices so it is still advisable to ensure that all features are accessible with the  basic keys like <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>, arrow, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>Escape</kbd>. </p>
      <p>The XHTML 2 Working Group is currently developing a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-access/">Access Module</a> to address this issue and we hope to have it or a feature like it in future versions of (X)HTML.  Refer to <a href="#aria_ex">Section 9: Implementation Guidance</a>. </p>

        <p>A <a class="role-reference" href="#tooltip">tooltip</a> is a  popup messages typically triggered by moving a mouse over a control or widget causing a small popup window to appear with additional information about the control. To provide simple text tooltips, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/global.html#h-7.4.3">HTML title attribute</a> should more than suffice because the user agent will render it for tooltips.

        <h3>When Keyboard Handlers Shortcuts Steal the Keys</h3>
        <p>
        Similar to the tip specified in <a href="#focus_tabindex">Using Tabindex to Manage Focus on Widgets</a>, a web application should cancel (or swallow) the keyboard event in the keyboard handler to prevent the key from being used outside the web application. For example if the user presses Control+PageDown in a tab panel in a web application, this keyboard event should not also go to the user agent, which would cycle the active browser tab, confusing the user.

      <h3>Providing Navigable Structure within Web Pages</h3>
      <p>This section takes a broader look at the Web page. It is intended to assist you in conveying a logical, usable, and accessible layout to an assistive technology or adaptive system designed to modify the visual layout to meet the users needs. </p>
      <p>One of the deficiencies of (X)HTML for disabled users has been the  usability of keyboard navigation. Users dependent on a keyboard for  navigation have been forced to tab everywhere in the document, as the  only keyboard accessible document elements are form and  anchor elements. This has forced developers to make most everything a  link to make it keyboard accessible, and to get to each link you have  to tab to it. With the advent of portals and other content aggregation  means Web pages are divided into visible regions and there has been no  vehicle to get to them other than perhaps to do things such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a skip link at the top of the page to the main content </li>
        <li>Make the head of each perceivable region (search bar, stock quote, TV Listing, etc.) an <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> tag </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are number of problems with this approach: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Both force the user interface to change to support accessibility </li>
        <li>In the case of using <code>&lt;H1&gt;</code> to mark your regions, this is not consistent across Web sites </li>
        <li>The semantics are limited to main content and a section</li>
        <li>Neither  convey the need for the  rich internet application developer to control keyboard navigation to an assistive technology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This remainder of this section provides the author with a playbook for using WAI-ARIA to add semantically rich navigation structure in a Web page so that an assistive technology may provide an effective  user experience and avoid these shortcomings.</p>
        <section id="kbd_layout_landmarks">
        <h4> Steps for Defining a Logical Navigational Structure</h4>
        <p><strong>Due to the complexity of today's web content, it is imperative that all content reside in a navigation landmark.</strong> Sight and mobility impaired users must be able to quickly access a list of landmarks for a web page, to be used as a table of contents.  This allows the user to quickly navigate to important sections of the page without "endless" TAB navigation.  If this is not done, then content will be orphaned and missed by the user.	In fact many of today's accessibility test tools have built-in rules to flag this issue as a compliance error.  This section defines how to create these navigable regions of the page:  </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p id="kbd_layout_landmark_IDRegions"><strong>Identify the logical structure of your page</strong></p>
            <p>Break up your page into perceivable block areas which contain semantically associated information called "regions". You can further break down each region into logical regions as needed. This is a common process undertaken by portal developers who break the page into perceivable regions called portlets. Think about the user wanting to navigate to these logical block areas on your Web page. Write down a description of what you believe each region to be.</p>
            <p> Depending on your Web application you may then need to break it into sub regions depending on the complexity of your Web application. This is a recursive process. A user will look at these perceivable areas like pealing an onion. You might have an outermost collection of perceivable regions or block areas and upon entering each region you may have a collection of regions within it. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p id="KBD_logicalstructuremarkup"><strong>Implement the logical structure in markup</strong></p>
            <p>Implementing the block structure in markup often involves wrapping elements contained with a "region" such as a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> with visible borders so that each region or block is perceivable to the user.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p id="KBD_layout_labelregion"><strong>Label each region</strong></p>
            <p> Once you have broken up each region you need to label it. The start of each region must have a perceivable header and it should be used to label the region. For details on how to do this see section <a href="#kbd_layout_nesting_vs_level">3.4.3.1 Header Levels vs. nesting level</a> to create a header to label each region. If you're finding it difficult to come up with a label for the region, make sure at least to use one of the standard roles defined in the following step. The drawback of not providing a label is that users will not know the purpose of the region. By definition, regions would be included in a summary of a page. If an assistive technology were to summarize it would be unable to provide information about the section without a label.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p id="kbd_layout_landmark_XHTML"><strong>Assign landmark roles to each region</strong></p>
            <p>Now that you labeled your regions, you need to assign them semantic navigation landmarks. Landmarks are a vast improvement over the rudimentary "skip to main content" technique employed prior to WAI-ARIA. If possible it is best to use these as landmarks. Skip to main content links may impact the placement of web application elements. This may be a consideration for developers that want to try to keep their web application in a specific visible area. Consequently, layout adjustments may need to be made to support skip to main content links. Also, skip to main content links are limited in that they only address only one main content area. WAI-ARIA provides a collection of landmarks which are applied to each of the regions you identified in step 2. </p>
            <p>The presence of common, semantic, navigation  landmarks allows each site to support the same standard and allows your  assistive technology to provide a consistent navigation experience - an important feature for screen readers and alternate input solutions. For users with cognitive and learning disabilities the landmark information could be used to expand and collapse these regions of your page to aid in simplifying the user experience by allowing the user to manage the amount of information processed at any one time. </p>
            <p>WAI-ARIA landmark roles that are applied to elements having strong native semantics are not mapped consistently to the platform accessibility API.  An example is the <code>TABLE</code> element.  For this reason, it is recommended that authors apply landmarks to <code>DIV</code> and <code>SPAN</code> containers. </p>
            <p>There are also mainstream benefits of providing navigation landmarks. Your browser may assign key sequences to move focus to these sections as they can be set on every site. Navigation to these landmarks is device independent. A personal digital assistant (PDA) could assign a device key to get to them in your document. The common landmarks in WAI-ARIA include: </p>
            <dl>
            <dt><a href="#application" class="role-reference">application</a></dt>
            <dd>
Represents a region of the page representing a unique software unit executing a set of tasks for its users. It is an area where assistive technologies should also return browse navigation keys back over to the web application in this region. 
  <p class="note">If the entire web page has a role of application then it should not be treated as a navigational landmark by an assistive technology.</p>
</dd>
              <dt><a href="#banner" class="role-reference">banner</a> </dt>
              <dd>A region that contains the prime heading or internal title of a page. </dd>
              <dt><a href="#complementary" class="role-reference">complementary</a> </dt>
              <dd>Any section of the document that supports but is separable from the main   content, but is meaningful on its own even when separated from it. </dd>
              <dt><a href="#contentinfo" class="role-reference">contentinfo</a> </dt>
              <dd>Meta information which applies to the first immediate ancestor whose role is   not presentation.</dd>
            	<dt><a href="#form" class="role-reference">form</a></dt>
            	<dd>A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing.</dd>
              <dt><a href="#main" class="role-reference">main</a> </dt>
              <dd>Main content in a document. </dd>
              <dt><a href="#navigation" class="role-reference">navigation</a> </dt>
              <dd>A collection of links suitable for use when navigating the document or   related documents.</dd>
              <dt><a href="#search" class="role-reference">search</a> </dt>
              <dd>The search tool of a Web document. </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>To set a landmark in your page: </p>
            <pre class="example higlight">&lt;div role="navigation" title="Table of Contents"&gt; &#8230; &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;div role="main" title="Game Statistics"&gt; &#8230; &lt;/div&gt;</pre>
          </li>
          <li id="kbd_layout_static"><strong>For application landmarks with static prose</strong>
       <p>
       If you have a regional landmark of type application and static descriptive text is available, then on the application landmark, include an aria-describedby reference to associate the application and the static text as shown here:</p><pre>&lt;div role="applicaton" aria-labelledby="calendar" aria-describedby="info"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="calendar"&gt;Calendar&lt;h1&gt;
&lt;p id="info"&gt;
This calendar shows the game schedule for the Boston Red Sox.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div role="grid"&gt;
&#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
       </li>
          <li id="kbd_layout_landmark_rebel"><strong>For  landmarks unsuited to specialized region WAI-ARIA roles</strong>
            <p>You can create custom regional landmarks by using a generic <a class="role-reference" href="#region">region</a>. While it is not essential to label these specialized regions with a header, you should provide a title to ensure that the region name is accessible to all users, just as you would the <a href="#kbd_layout_landmark_XHTML">standard regional landmarks</a>. See <a href="#kbd_layout_nesting_vs_level">Header levels versus Nesting levels</a> for directions on how to label the region.</p>
            <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="main"&gt; &#8230; &lt;div role="region" title="weather"&gt;  
</pre>
            <p>Note: the <a class="role-reference" href="#region">region</a> role is generic and should only be used when a more specific role is not applicable.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Indicate to the assistive technology who controls the keyboard navigation</strong></p>
            <p> Today's screen readers for the blind have been designed to give the user a "browsing" experience meaning the screen reader consumes  a number of keys to aid in the browsing experience. For example, the "up" and "down" arrow keys are used to read the next and previous line of text on your Web page. Accessible rich internet applications will use these keys in an application to navigate within "widgets" like a <a href="#TreeView">Tree View</a>.</p>
            <p> Assistive technologies must be able to identify widgets which implement WAI-ARIA and allow them use of the keyboard. However, if you have used  numerous widgets to form an application you must set the role on the encompassing region to <a class="role-reference" href="#application">application</a>. Should you have regions which should be browsed as documents within the application region you should mark those regions with a <a class="role-reference" href="#document">document</a> role as needed. See section <a href="#kbd_layout_impact">3.4.2 Structural Roles used to facilitate assistive technology navigation</a>.          </p>

        <section id="kbd_layout_impact">
        <h4> Structural Roles that Facilitate  Navigation with Assistive Technologies</h4>
        While WAI-ARIA is designed to address many disabilities, this section is best described in terms of screen reader use. In desktop applications, screen readers typically treat widgets as discrete entities, reading and interacting with each widget one at a time. The user moves the point of focus from widget to widget using tab/shift tab, mnemonics, or accelerators, keyboard commands which are usually provided by the application or the operating system. We refer to this mode of interaction as "application mode."
        <p>When viewing Web content however, screen readers often gather information about all the widgets in an area and present them in a document-like view which the user navigates using keyboard commands provided and controlled by the screen reader. Think of this mode as a virtual environment that presents Web content in a way that makes it convenient for adaptive technology users to navigate and read. This is sometimes called browse mode, or virtual mode. We refer to this as "document browse mode." </p>
        <p>Because many screen readers provide document mode navigation support using single key mnemonics on the alpha-numeric keyboard, they may provide a third mode, called "forms mode," used to interact with form controls that are encountered in document mode. Behavior in forms mode is similar to that of application mode. The key feature of forms mode is that it can be toggled with document mode to make it easy to both interact with a specific widget, and read virtualized content of which the widget is a part. Since, as described above, a screen reader's perception of an area as either a document or an application greatly influences how the user reads and interacts with it, WAI-ARIA provides content authors a way to indicate whether their pages must be viewed as applications or documents by assistive technologies. </p>
        <p>To set document or application mode follow these steps: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p id="kbd_layout_impact_approle"><strong>Set the Application Role</strong></p>
            <p>After you have divided your Web page into regions through the use of role landmarks and custom regions, you must make a decision: Is your Web page an application or not? If the majority of the content is application-like the default interaction mode should be set to <span class="role-reference">application</span>, with <span class="role-reference">document</span> regions embedded within the application if applicable. Otherwise the default interaction mode is document-like and therefore should not be overridden by the use of a global role of <span class="role-reference">application</span>. In this case the <span class="role-reference">application</span> role can be placed on discrete regions within the document if applicable. </p>
			<p>If it is, set the role of <a class="role-reference" href="#application">application</a> on the body tag as follows: </p>
            <pre class="example highlight">&lt;body role="application"&gt; </pre>
            <p> When using <a class="role-reference" href="#application">application</a>, all static text must be associated with widgets, groups or panes via using the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a> and <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-describedby">aria-describedby</a> properties, otherwise it will not be read by the screen reader when the user navigates to the related widget or group.</p>
            <p>Special Considerations: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you have selected to have a role of application on the body tag, it is recommended that a widget have focus after the page is first loaded. There may be an instance when an application itself needs to receive focus, such as an application consisting solely of a scrollable editable text area. </li>
              <li>If when your page loads and you should have  focus on a widget this is a strong indicator that your Web page should have role of <a class="role-reference" href="#application">application</a>.</li>
              <li>If your page has only a few isolated widgets, like pop-up calendars located on a Web page, it is not necessary to expressly set the role of application on the body. Screen readers, based on widget roles, must be able to provide access to these widgets without recognizing the entire page as an application. </li>
              <li>Also, browsers make use of a feature called the contenteditable attribute, which will be incorporated into HTML 5. Contenteditable allows an author to turn the browser section into a rich text editor, similar to a word processor. Any section which has contenteditable set to "true" is considered a widget. </li>
              <li>If the body element has been given the role of application, please follow step 3. Otherwise, the Web page is considered a document, and no further action is required in this regard. </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Dialogs and alert dialogs - special case application roles</strong>
            <p> WAI-ARIA provides <a class="role-reference" href="#dialog">dialog</a> and <a class="role-reference" href="#alertdialog">alertdialog</a> roles that are to be treated as special case <a class="role-reference" href="#application">application</a> roles. Like application, screen readers will leave the main job of  keyboard navigation up the dialog. </p>
            <p> When using <a class="role-reference" href="#dialog">dialog</a>, all static text must be associated with widgets, groups or panes using the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a> and <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-describedby">aria-describedby</a> properties, otherwise it will not be read by the screen reader when the user navigates to the related widget or group. Unlike an application, your Web page is unlikely to start out as either of these two roles but rather the author is most likely to dynamically create dialogs or alertdialog sections within the Web page.</p>
            <p> Unlike <a class="role-reference" href="#dialog">dialog</a>, descriptive text of the alert does not need to be associated via a relationship, as the contents of alert dialogs will be read automatically by the screen reader when the dialog opens.          </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Set the document role</strong> </li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The default mode for a screen reader to be processing an HTML Web page is document browse mode. This is equivalent to having a role of document on the HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag. If you have already specified a role of application on the body tag there may be times in which you tell the screen reader to switch into "document browse mode" and start stealing the necessary keys to browse a document section of your Web page. These keys are the typical keys used by WAI-ARIA widgets and to provide this level of navigation the keys must be stolen from your browser. </p>
          <p>To mark areas of your page to tell the assistive technology when to switch into document browse mode, look at the regions/landmarks you have defined and determine which ones must be browsed as a document or navigated as an application. For each region which must be browsed in document browse mode, embed a div element within it with the role of <a class="role-reference" href="#document">document</a> as follows: </p>
          <pre class="example higlight">&lt;div role="document"&gt; </pre>
          <p>Now, when a screen reader encounters this region, it will change its interaction model to that of  document browsing mode. </p>

If you have a heading and there is no element containing the content that it heads, wrap the content in a &lt;div&gt; bearing this <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a> attribute. If headings are organized into a logical outline, the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-level">aria-level</a> property can be used to indicate the nesting level. Here is an example with and without ARIA. Note that the preferred way is using native semantics without ARIA, but the approach with ARIA is shown first to demonstrate use of the heading role:</p>
          <pre class="example highlight">Using ARIA:
&lt;div role="main" aria-labelledby="page_title"&gt;
  &lt;p id="page_title" role="heading" aria-level=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Top News Stories&lt;/p&gt;
   … main page contents here …
&lt;/div&gt;

Using native markup:
&lt;div role="main" aria-labelledby="page_title"&gt;
  &lt;h1 id="page_title"&gt;Top News Stories&lt;/h1&gt;
   … main page contents here …
&lt;/div&gt;

          <h5>Owns Repairs Nesting</h5>
          <p>Assistive technology briefs users on the context where they are. When they arrive at a new page, a page summary may be given. When they move into a new context, some of the labeling from elements containing the new focus or reading location may be rendered by the assistive technology, to give context to the details to be read next. </p>
          <p>The syntactic structure of a page provides the default nesting of contexts. If a paragraph is nested in a &lt;div&gt; or table cell, it is assumed that labels for the &lt;div&gt; or headers for the table cell are pertinent to what is in the paragraph. On the other hand, it is not possible to always flow the logical structure one-to-one into the parse structure. </p>
          <p>The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> relationship is provided to annotate logical nesting where the logical child is not a syntactic descendant of the logical parent. In a Rich Internet Application, updates may be made to the document without updating the logical syntactic structure, yet elements may appear to be added to the document structure. From a DOM and accessibility hierarchy perspective <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> is a fallback mechanism to using the tree hierarchy provided in the DOM. An example  of where <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> is needed is a <a class="role-reference" href="#treeitem">treeitem</a>, where children in a folder subtree are added to a visible subtree but not reflected in the actual document subtree of the folder. The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> relationship can be used to associate the folder with the new "adopted" child. For more details on the use of <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> see <a href="#relations_owning">section 4.2 Owning and Controlling</a>. The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> relationship is used to indicate to a user agent that a menu is an adopting parent of a sub <a class="role-reference" href="#menu">menu</a>.  Another use for <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> is a hierarchical diagram  where the child nodes of the diagram are not be adequately represented using the DOM structure. </p>

          <h5> Groups and Their Applicability </h5>
          <p>Authors should use a role of <a class="role-reference" href="#group">group</a> to form logical collections of items with related functionality in a widget. A group should not be considered a major perceivable section on a page. A <a class="role-reference" href="#group">group</a> neither has a heading nor appears in the &quot;Table of Contents.&quot;  A <a class="role-reference" href="#group">group</a> may  delineate a set of <a class="role-reference" href="#treeitem">treeitem</a>s having the same level in the <a class="role-reference" href="#tree">tree</a> or it may be used to group a set of related checkboxes in a form. Other examples include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a <a class="role-reference" href="#row">row</a> in a grid (a row is a specialized group representing a row in a grid); </li>
            <li>a <a class="role-reference" href="#group">group</a> of children in a tree widget forming a collection of siblings in a hierarchy; or </li>
            <li>a <a class="role-reference" href="#group">group</a> of items having the same container in a directory </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Proper handling of a group by assistive technologies, therefore, is determined by the context in which it is provided. Group members that are outside the DOM subtree of the group need to have explicit relationships assigned for them in order to participate in the group. Groups may also be nested. </p>
          <p>If an author believes that a section is significant enough in terms of the entire document instance, then the author must assign the section a role of <code class="role-reference">region</code> or one of the designated standard landmarks. The designated landmark roles are listed in the section <a href="#kbd_layout_landmarks">Regions and XHTML Role landmarks</a>.</p>

          <h5> Regions and Their Use </h5>
        	<p>When defining a region for a section of a document, authors must consider using standard document landmark roles defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab/">XHTML Vocabulary</a>. This makes it possible for user agents and assistive technologies to treat roles as standard navigation landmarks. If the definition of these regions is inadequate, authors must use the WAI-ARIA <a class="role-reference" href="#region">region</a> role and provide the appropriate title text. </p>

          <h5> Tabular Structure-Related Roles Supporting Tabular Widgets</h5>
          <p>A number of structural roles support the tabular widgets, <a class="role-reference" href="#grid">grid</a> and <a class="role-reference" href="#treegrid">treegrid</a>. These structural roles indicate additional keyboard navigation as well as the ability to select rows and/or columns. Typically, you would apply these roles to an underlying table in the base markup as shown here:</p>
          <pre class="example highlight">&lt;table role="grid"&gt;		</pre>
          <p>However, that may not work for the developer in all instances, such as when the developer has need for a &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; or when additional semantics are needed. To assist, the following roles are provided to support tabular widgets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a class="role-reference" href="#columnheader">columnheader</a> </li>
            <li><a class="role-reference" href="#grid">grid</a> </li>
            <li><a class="role-reference" href="#gridcell">gridcell</a></li>
            <li><a class="role-reference" href="#row">row</a> </li>
            <li><a class="role-reference" href="#rowheader">rowheader</a></li>
            <li><a class="role-reference" href="#treegrid">treegrid</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>When constructing a <a class="role-reference" href="#grid">grid </a>or <a class="role-reference" href="#treegrid">treegrid</a> the author must use <a class="role-reference" href="#gridcell">gridcell</a>s for the actual cells:</p>
          <pre class="example highlight">&lt;table role="grid"&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td role= "columnheader"&gt;Apples&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td role= "columnheader"&gt;Oranges&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td role="gridcell"&gt;Macintosh&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td role="gridcell"&gt;Valencia&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
          <p>Unlike table cells within a table, authors should ensure a grid's  <a class="role-reference" href="#gridcell">gridcell</a>s are focusable through the use of tabindex (in HTML), or <a href="#aria-activedescendant" class="property-reference">aria-activedescendant</a> on the grid.They may also be editable, as is shown in the above example. </p>
          <p>Treegrid's may require expanding and collapsing rows which may not be performed using a &lt;tr&gt;. In these instances authors will use an HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. WAI-ARIA provides a role of <a class="role-reference" href="#row">row</a> which may be assigned to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to convey to the assistive technology that this is still a row. If you decide to not use the native HTML &lt;table&gt; elements and choose more flexible elements, such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s, with applied WAI-ARIA roles in this section, you should structurally lay out your elements in line with what you would expect from HTML. All of your <a class="role-reference" href="#rowheader">rowheader</a>s should be in a <a class="role-reference" href="#row">row</a> and your <a class="role-reference" href="#gridcell">gridcell</a>s should be children of each subsequent row in the same format as HTML for <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>s and <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>s within <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>s.</p>

          <h5> Marking Descriptive Sections</h5>
          <p>     
          A new feature of WAI-ARIA is the ability to associate descriptive text with a section, drawing, form element, picture, and so on using the <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a> property.  The use case for <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a> is to reference the local <code>id</code> of the long description.  The most common use case for <code>longdesc</code> is for the author to create a separate file to describe a picture.  It is prefereable to have the descriptive text in prose as well so that it is readily available to all users.  This is useful for authors who do not want to create a separate document that contains the description, and for cognitively impaired users who can be confused by context changes when having to go to another page for the description. Yet, like <code>longdesc</code>, descriptive text is treated separately from the short name provided by the <code>title</code> or <code>alt</code> attributes in HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
          	The <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a> property allows for the text of <a class="specref termref" href="#dfn-hidden">hidden</a> elements to be used for accessible descriptions.  Some screen reader vendors have used non-standard attributes to provide hidden help text for <code>form</code> elements.  In order to standardize this feature, hidden text is exposed in the description property of <a class="specref termref" href="#dfn-accessibility-api">Accessibility API</a> objects when referenced by <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a>.
          </p>
          <pre class="example highlight">&lt;img src="foo" alt="abbreviated name" aria-describedby="prose1"&gt;

&lt;div id="prose1"&gt;
   The prose in this div describes the image foo in detail.
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
          <p> This is the preferred vehicle for providing long descriptions for elements in your document.</p>
          <p> When the author does not desire the entire descriptive text to be located on the main page, aria-describedby can also be used to point to a link to another page. </p>
          <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div id="figuretitle"&gt;Figure 1-1: Entity Relationship Diagram showing EMP and DEPT&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;img src="foo" aria-labelledby="figuretitle" aria-describedby="link1"&gt;
  &lt;a href="descriptionLocation.html" id="link1"&gt;Description of Figure 1-1: Entity Relationship Diagram showing EMP and DEPT&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
        </section>
        <p>It is not good practice to use the above pattern when the describing element&#8212;the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag with <code>@id='link1'</code>&#8212;is <a class="specref termref" href="#dfn-hidden">hidden</a>, since there is no way for a user to navigate to and activate the link.  Use the technique only when the description is not hidden. </p>
      </section>
        <section id="misc_xhtml2_roles">
        <h4> Miscellaneous XHTML Section Roles</h4>
        <p>In order to synchronize with the XHTML Role Attribute module, WAI-ARIA includes two XHTML roles which are neither landmarks nor widgets of any kind. These roles were incorporated to replace standard elements found in host languages. These roles are <a class="role-reference" href="#definition">definition</a> and <a class="role-reference" href="#note">note</a>. If either role has a corresponding element in the host language, it is recommended that authors use the corresponding element in the host language.</p>
        <p>The <a class="role-reference" href="#definition">definition</a> role indicates a definition statement in your document. For HTML developers implementing lists of definitions, we recommend    you using the DL, DT, and DD elements rather than marking an arbitrary    element with a role of definition. An arbitrary element would be    appropriate for inline definitions used in conjunction with the DFN    element. </p>
        <p>Example of an inline definition with an explicit labelledby relationship:</p>
        <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;p&gt;The doctor explained it had been a &lt;dfn id="placebo"&gt;placebo&lt;/dfn&gt;, &lt;span role="definition" aria-labelledby="placebo"&gt;  
an inert preparation prescribed more for the mental relief of the patient than for its actual effect on a disorder.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>Example of an inline definition with an implicit labelledby relationship    determined by nesting:</p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;p&gt;The doctor explained it had been a &lt;span role="definition"&gt;
&lt;dfn&gt;placebo&lt;/dfn&gt;, an inert preparation prescribed more for the mental relief of the patient than for its actual effect on a disorder.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>Note: In the case where host language semantics do not allow for    implicit nesting of definitions terms inside definition roles, authors    should explicitly use the aria-labelledby attribute, even when the    definition term is nested in the definition as shown here:</p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;p&gt;The doctor explained it had been a &lt;span role="definition" aria-labelledby="placebo"&gt;
&lt;dfn id="placebo"&gt;placebo&lt;/dfn&gt;, an inert preparation prescribed more for the mental relief of the patient than for its actual effect on a disorder.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>The following is an example using a definition list:</p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt id="anathema"&gt;anthema&lt;/dt&gt;
 &lt;dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="anathema"&gt;a ban or curse solemnly pronounced by ecclesiastical authority and accompanied by  
excommunication&lt;/dd&gt;
 &lt;dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="anathema"&gt;a vigorous denunciation : cursor&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt id="homily"&gt;homily&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="homily"&gt;a usually short sermon&lt;/dd&gt;  

&lt;dd role="definition" aria-labelledby="homily"&gt;a lecture or discourse on or of a moral theme&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;</pre>
        <p>The <a class="role-reference" href="#note">note</a> role defines a parenthetic or ancillary remark to the <a class="role-reference" href="#main">main</a> content of the resource. It also allows assistive technologies to skip over this section of the document unless more information is requested about the main content.</p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="main" aria-labelledby="foo"&gt;
   &lt;h1 id="foo"&gt;Wild fires spread across the San Diego Hills&lt;/h1&gt;
   Strong winds expand fires ignited by high temperatures &#8230;

    <section id="modal_dialog">
 <h3 id="make_modal">Making a Dialog Modal</h3>
<p>
WAI-ARIA provides for two dialog roles - dialog and alertdialog. When authors simulate dialogs on a web page they often limit their interaction considerations to the mouse. Unlike Graphical User Interface dialog boxes on a desktop computer, a user during keyboard navigation could accidentally navigate outside the dialog box and become disoriented. This can happen when the user is tabbing in the dialog. A modal dialog prevents the user from setting focus outside of the dialog until the dialog is closed. Mouse clicks outside of the dialog must be ignored and the user must not be able to tab into or out of the dialog itself. All WAI-ARIA enabled dialog boxes should be modal. This section describes how. 
</p>
<p>
Mouse clicks outside of the dialog can be prevented by creating a CSS positioned element that is the size of the viewport to append as a child of the body element. Set the CSS z-index of this element so that it is above all other elements on the page except for the dialog element. Set the tabindex of the underlay element to tabindex="-1" to prevent it from receiving focus via a keyboard event or mouse click. You may lower the opacity of the underlay element in order to emphasize that the dialog itself is modal and has focus. 
</p>
<p>
Depending upon the action to be performed by the dialog, the object with focus before the dialog box is opened should be saved. This will allow restoring focus to this element when the dialog box is closed. When the dialog box is opened, focus should be set to the first tab focusable element within the dialog. If there is no tab focusable element within the dialog box contents, set the focus to the item that is used to cancel or close the dialog. There must be some element within the dialog which can accept focus in order for the screen reader to speak the dialog title and information when it is opened. In order to prevent keyboard focus from leaving the dialog, determine the first and last tab focusable elements in the dialog and trap keyboard events within the document. 
</p>
<p>
Search the contents of the dialog container to find the first and last tab focusable elements. This can be implemented by walking the DOM tree of the dialog container to find all visible and enabled anchor elements, input elements, and all elements that have a tabindex value greater than or equal to 0. Remember that elements with a tabindex > 0 will appear in the tab order before all other focusable elements in ascending order by tabindex. Store the first and last tab focusable items within variables in the scope of the dialog box code. 
</p>
<p>
Before the dialog is shown, create and display the dialog underlay. Connect an onkeypress event handler to the DOM document.documentElement. This will catch all keystrokes on the document and allow trapping keyboard focus within the dialog. Size and position the dialog box in the viewport above the underlay, make it visible and set focus to the first tab focusable item in the dialog box.
</p>
      <section id="trap_focus_div">
<h4 id="trap_focus">Trapping Focus</h4>
<p>
The onkeypress handler will catch all key presses within the document. This onkeypress event handler should be within the scope of the dialog box code so that it has access to the first and last tab focusable elements within the dialog. In the onkeypress handler determine the target of the keypress event. In addition, determine if there is only a single focusable item within the dialog box. In this instance the first tab navigable object will equal the last tab navigable object. If key presses within the dialog box may create, destroy, enable, disable, or change the visibility of tab focusable elements, then determine the first and last tab-focusable items each time a keypress is received. Based on the event target and the key pressed take the following actions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If the keypress is a <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> key and the target == the first tab navigable object, then set focus to the last tab-navigable object and stop the key press event. If there is only a single tab focusable item, then focus does not have to be set, but the key press event must be stopped. 
</li>
<li>
If the keypress is a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key and the target == the last tab navigable object, then set focus to the first tab-navigable object and stop the keypress event. If there is only a single tab-focusable item, then focus does not have to be set but the keypress event must must be stopped.
</li>
<li>
If the keypress is an <kbd>Escape</kbd> key and the target node is the container node for the dialog box, then close the dialog box and hide or destroy the dialog underlay.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Determine if the target node of the keypress is within the dialog box container. This can be done using a while loop to walk the parent chain of the target node until the container node of the dialog box is found. Other than those outlined above, all key presses from within the dialog box should be allowed to execute so that the user can interact with the controls in the dialog box.
</p>
<p>
If the target node is not within the dialog box, the keypress is from the documentElement and the keypress event should be stopped unless it is a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key press. Allowing a <kbd>Tab</kbd> key press from the document element will enable tabbing back into the dialog box if, for some reason, focus on the dialog box is lost. This can happen due to timing issues when the dialog box is first loaded and focus does not properly get set to the first tab-focusable item within the dialog. 
</p>
<p>
The dialog box itself should contain buttons or other mechanisms to cancel the dialog box or execute the dialog box functions and close the dialog box. 
</p>
<p>
Here is a pseudo code onkeypress handler for a modal dialog box. Pseudo code is used to focus on the actions in the handler rather than on the differences in browser event handling. Assume that the event object, evt, has been normalized between browsers and the helper object is a library of functions that handle browser differences. The keys object is a set of key definition variables. Dialog is the dialog box object, which has a function to cancel the dialog. 
</p>
<pre>
_onKey: function(/*Normalized Event*/ evt){
// summary:
// Handles the keyboard events for accessibility reasons
if(evt.charOrCode){
var node = evt.target; // get the target node of the keypress event

  <p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from APG version 1.0 -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
    <section id="relations_labeling">
    <h3> Labeling and Describing</h3>
    <p>Marked up  content or widgets will often need additional context to make clear  what the meaning or purpose is. It is also reasonable that some content  media types will need additional descriptions in another format to give  clarity to those who are unable to consume the origin format. These  additional meta-content sections are linked together by tagging them as  labels or descriptions. WAI-ARIA provides the <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference">aria-labelledby</a> and <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a> attributes to signal the browser to feed these relationships into the  accessibility layer. This layer is then used by screen readers and  other accessibility technology (AT) to gain awareness of how disparate  regions are actually contextually connected to each other. With this  awareness the AT can then present a meaningful navigation model for  discovery and presentation of these additional content sections. The  user agent itself can also choose to present these insights in a  meaningful way. Generally you should always add these attributes to any  widgets on your site as they are often merely a construct of HTML and JavaScript which provides no obvious insight as to what the widget's behavior or interactivity is. </p>
      <section id="LabeledBy">
      <h4>Labeling</h4>
     When using one element to label another use the  <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference">aria-labelledby</a> by attribute. A label should provide the user with the essence of what the object does. For example, you could have a dialog box erected from HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and you need to assocate a label for the dialog. With a WAI-ARIA role of dialog, you can indicate its widget type and define a label using an HTML header and then associate that label with the dialog using the <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference">aria-labelledby</a> relationship.
     <pre>
	&lt;div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialogheader"&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="dialogheader"&gt;Choose a File&lt;/h2&gt;
	&#8230; Dialog contents
	&lt;/div&gt;
	</pre>
      <p>The section doing the labeling might be referenced by multiple  widgets or objects as these need only reference the same id, so contextual description may not always be viable. The labelledby attribute can have multiple ids specified as a space separated list much like applying multiple classes to a single DOM object.</p>
      <p>The <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference">aria-labelledby</a> property can be used to label all visual objects, however it should be noted that (X)HTML provides a @<code>for</code> attribute on the <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#h-17.9">label</a></code> element which is used to label form controls. Use this attribute where possible and valid. Because the aria-labelledby attribute accepts multiple IDREFs, it is recommended that authors use aria-labelledby for labeling elements that require more than one label string.</p>
      <p class="note">Some elements receive their label for embedded text content, but that is the exception.</p>
      <p class="note">Often user agents will operate with images turned off for network performance reasons. In these situations, <code>alt</code> text is provided in the place of the image. When the host language provides alternative text capability it is recommended that authors use the alternative text to support these situations and not use separate labeling as a replacement.</p>

      <section id="Descriptions">
      <h4>Describing</h4>
        <section id="Descriptions_describedby">
      	<h4>Using aria-describedby</h4>
      	<p>When one element  describes another, use the <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a> attribute. An <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a> section provides further information about a given object or widget,  which may not be intuitively obvious from the context, content or other  attributes. For example, a fake window is a common widget used in Web  applications and is often constructed using a div absolute  positioned in a layer above other content. To simulate common window  behavior look and feel there is often an X box in the corner which,  when activated, dismisses the window widget. One common way to make  this X box is to simply make a link whose content is an X. This doesn't  give a non-visual user much to go on and belies the real purpose of the  X link. To help we add more descriptive text stored elsewhere in the  page like this: </p>
      	<pre class="example highlight">&lt;button aria-label="Close" aria-describedby="descriptionClose" 
    onclick="myDialog.close();"&gt;X&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
      	and then elsewhere in the HTML
      	<pre class="example highlight">&lt;div id="descriptionClose"&gt;Closing this window will discard any information entered and 
return you back to the main page&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
      	Like labelledby, describedby can accept multiple ids to point to other regions of the page using a space separated list. It is also limited to ids for defining these sets. In our contrived example we would also want a good labelledby  section to fully explain what the window does and how closing will  effect the task being worked on. If an object or widget lacks describedby the user agent or AT may try to extract information from the label or th tags, if present. The label and th tags have limited use in that they can only be applied to forms or tables, respectively.
      	</section>
        <section id="Descriptions_tooltip">
      	<h4>Using a tooltip as a description</h4>
      	<p>WAI-ARIA also defines the <a class="role-reference" href="#tooltip">tooltip</a> role to which <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-describedby">aria-describedby</a> may reference an author defined tooltip. The assistive  technology  can tell from the type of object describing the document  element what  the purpose of that element is. For example, a screen  reader could announce the tooltip without the user having to wave the mouse over the element by following the describedby relationship to a  document area with a <a class="role-reference" href="#tooltip">tooltip</a> role. The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-describedby">aria-describedby</a> property is also useful for describing <a class="role-reference" href="#group">group</a>s. </p>
      	<p>Here is a code snippet showing a set of the tooltip: </p>
      	<pre class="example highlight">&#8230;    
  &lt;div class="text"&gt;
    &lt;label for="first"&gt;First Name:&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input type="text"               
          id="first"           
          name="first"            
          size="20"           
          onfocus="tooltipShow(tooltip1);"          
          onblur="tooltipHide(tooltip1);"
          onmouseover="tooltipShow(tooltip1);"           
          onmouseout="tooltipHide(tooltip1);"           
          aria-describedby="tp1"
      /&gt;
  &lt;div id="tp1" class="tooltip" role="tooltip"&gt;Your first name is optional&lt;/div&gt;    
  &lt;/div&gt;    
&#8230;  </pre>
      		</section>
        <section id="Descriptions_external">
		<h4>Descriptions on external pages</h4>
    	<p>The <code class="property-reference">aria-describedby</code> property is not designed to reference descriptions on an external resource&#8212;since it is an IDREF, it must reference an element in the same DOM document. This is different from the HTML <code>longdesc</code> attribute, which accepts any URI. In general, the preferred pattern for WAI-ARIA applications is to include all relevant resources in the same DOM, But if you wish to reference an external resource with <code class="property-reference">aria-describedby</code>, you can reference a link that in turn references the external resource. This requires the user to follow two steps, first following the <code class="property-reference">aria-describedby</code> arc, then following the link, but does address the use case. The following example demonstrates this:</p>
    	<pre class="example highlight">&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;img
       src="images/histogram.png"
       alt="Histogram of Blackberry tree heights"
       width="40%"
       aria-describedby="longdesc1"
   /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a id="longdesc1" href="blackberry-description.html" target="_description"&gt;Data for Blackberry Histogram&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    </section>
    </section>
    <p>It is not good practice to use the above pattern when the describing element&#8212;the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag with <code>@id='longdesc1'</code>&#8212;is <a class="specref termref" href="#dfn-hidden">hidden</a>, since there is no way for a user to navigate to and activate the link.  Use the technique only when the description is not hidden. </p>

    <section id="relations_owning">
    <h3> Owning and Controlling</h3>
    <p>Two relationships expand the logical structure  of a WAI-ARIA Web application. These are <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> and <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> .  The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> relationship completes the parent/child relationship when it cannot be completely determined from the DOM created from the parsing of the markup. The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> relationship defines a cause-and-effect relationship so that assistive technologies may navigate to content effected by and changes to the content where the user is operating. </p>
      <section id="relations_owns">
      <h4> The Owns Relationship</h4>
      <p>In addition to WAI-ARIA role and state information, for a document element,
an assistive technology needs to convey its context. In
the case of a <span class="role-reference">treeitem</span>, it is important to know the parent (container),
 which may provide a folder depth and the number of siblings in the folder. This containment hierarchy can often be determined by
the DOM tree, as it provides parent, siblings, and children for a given
document element. That said, the DOM hierarchy is rigid and acyclical in
that each node may only have one parent. In some situations, a child
is reused by multiple parents or a child is separated from its
sibilings or parent in the DOM tree. One example is when a radio button
appears in a table but it is not a DOM child of the radiogroup, due to the
authors use of a table for formatting and the placement of the radio buttons
placing them outside the radiogroup container. To solve this problem
WAI-ARIA provides the <span class="property-reference">aria-owns</span> property.</p>
<p>
The <span class="property-reference">aria-owns</span> property is set on a document element, and its values are the
unique IDs of all the adopted children. These elements may appear anywhere
in the DOM, yet they are treated as siblings of each owning parent. This
example illustrates a <span class="role-reference">radiogroup</span> that first uses the DOM hierarchy to
convey context and then <span class="property-reference">aria-owns</span>:</p>
<p>First, consider the preferred method for using the W3C DOM to describe the relationship between
  <span class="role-reference">radiogroup</span> and <span class="role-reference">radio</span>  roles for HTML:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div id="radio_label">My radio label&lt;/div>
&lt;ul role="radiogroup" aria-labelledby="radio_label">
&lt;li role="radio">Item #1&lt;/li>
&lt;li role="radio">Item #2&lt;/li>
&lt;li role="radio">Item #3&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
</pre>
<p>
In this example, the elements with <code>role="radio"</code> are child nodes of the parent <code>role="radiogroup"</code> element node.

</p>
<p>
Now, consider an alternative method using the <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property to describe the parent-child
role relationship between <a href="#radiogroup" class="role-reference">radiogroup</a> and <a href="#radio" class="role-reference">radio</a> roles for HTML:</p>
<pre>
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td role="radiogroup" aria-owns="myradio1 myradio2 myradio3" rowspan="3" &gt;
My Radio Label
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td id="myradio1" role="radio"&gt;Item #1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td id="myradio2" role="radio"&gt;Item #2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td id="myradio3" role="radio"&gt;Item #3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
<p class="note">
The <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property should be used sparingly, since it
increases the computational load on assistive technology to provide
alternative renderings. Also, when accessing the DOM and enumerating
children of a DOM node, an AT should then enumerate the adopted children
using the <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property. At that instance of walking the DOM, the
parent of the adopted children is the adopted parent and not the DOM
parent. This will avoid recursion problems.</p>
<p>
Each child, adopted or natural, should have the appropriate
  <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-posinset">aria-posinset</a> and <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-setsize">aria-setsize</a> properties set consistent with their
rendering, if these cannot be determined from the DOM from a direct parsing of
the host language. Places where direct parsing does not allow the user
agent to determine 
  <span class="property-reference">aria-posinset</span> and <span class="property-reference">aria-setsize</span>  are long lists where only
the currently visible items are loaded (via Ajax). If the children are
re-sorted then the 
  <span class="property-reference">aria-posinset</span> and <span class="property-reference">aria-setsize</span>  values should be updated
consistent with their visual rendering. Rather than setting  size only on a container, content authors should specify aria-setsize on each  member of a set to avoid performance issues. &#160;If this property is not set,  the user agent must compute and set the property on supporting roles.</p>
<p> Platform accessibility API mappings must invert this relationship for
  assistive technologies, so that they may determine the owning parent from a
  child and couple it with <span class="property-reference">aria-posinset</span> and <span class="property-reference">aria-setsize</span>  information to
  provide context information to the user.</p>

      <section id="relations_owns_reuse">
      <h4>  Using Owns with Reusable Content</h4>
      <p>If  you are re-using content across different, transient  sections of content by restyling it to render it in association with a different object, you need to maintain the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> property   as well to match the current use and apparent ancestry of the reused  sub-section. A good example of this is a context help menu that resides at the end of the document. When the user wishes to launch the context help menu in association with different visual elements, styling is used to render the menu in context with that object. Prior to rendering the visual submenu you should ensure the object to which you have requested help assigns its <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> property value to the submenu ID. When the menu closes you can remove the <span class="property-reference">aria-owns</span> property. </p>
    </section>
      <section id="relations_controls">
      <h4> The Controls Relationship</h4>
      <p>In rich internet applications document elements may control the behavior on another part of Web page outside themselves. The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> attribute indicates cause-and-effect relationships between document  elements. </p>
      <p>An example might be a group of <a class="role-reference" href="#radio">radio</a> buttons that "control" contents of a <a class="role-reference" href="#listbox">listbox</a> in another part of the page. Here, you would want the radio group to assign a <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> relationship to the <a class="role-reference" href="#listbox">listbox</a> which will be updating without a page reload. The user, through their assistive technology, can then navigate to the <a class="role-reference" href="#listbox">listbox</a> by following the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> relationship when a different radio is selected, to see how the contents changed in the <a class="role-reference" href="#listbox">listbox</a>. The ability to update parts of a page without a page reload is a common practice of applications making use of Ajax. Without the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> attribute, a user would be unable to effectively use these types of Web pages as assistive technologies often will not make the user aware of what is happening outside the context of the element the user is currently operating.</p>
      <p>With the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> attribute the user may use the assistive technology to follow the relationship to the object it is controlling. It is extremely important for an assistive technology to present changes in the document in response to user input. Therefore, an assistive technology immediately presents changes to a live region when the controlling widget is the one which has user keyboard focus. For example, if a tree view controls a help document pane, each time<br/>
        the tree item changes the new tree item and then the new help contents should also be read. In the case of a screen reader, the amount of information  read in the target live region is dependent on <a href="#liveprops">how the live region is configured</a>. </p>
      <p>The <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> attribute takes one or more ids which refer to the document element. If this relationship is not implied by the host  language semantics, then the controlling element must be given a controls attribute with the IDs of the other elements where the changes will  show up listed in the attribute value.</p>

    <section id="relations_flowto">
    <h3> Changing the Reading Flow</h3>
    <p>(X)HTML suffers from a number of disadvantages in  keyboard navigation today. One such example is the restriction of  navigation to the tabbing order. This is a common problem with  presentations in office suites where the logical, perceivable,  navigation order of a slide may not match the tabbing order. Sighted  users may see a logical navigation process (such as visual steps in the  process for assembling a lawn mower). This "flow" is not conveyed by  the tab order. The user might tab from step 1 and land on step 4.  Another problem is the construction of model-based authoring tools on a  Web page. In a model-based authoring tool, a visual object may provide  a number of paths that the user can take, such as a multiplexor, which  may have output that logically flows to a number of optional electronic  components in a drawing. In Web 2.0, developers are actually creating  drawings like this to perform tasks such as visually model a work flow.  In this scenario, the user will want to decide which object they will  navigate their screen reader or alternate input device to next. </p>
    <p>Although it is  recommended that Tab order follow the reading flow, there may be instances  where this is not possible. For these reasons, WAI-ARIA provides a relationship property, called <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-flowto">aria-flowto</a>. This allows the author to provide an assistive technology with alternative navigation flows through the document that best represents the author's intent and which is more logical for people with disabilities. <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-flowto">aria-flowto</a> establishes the recommended reading order of content, so that the an assistive may overriding the default of reading in document order to its user. <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-flowto">aria-flowto</a> does not change the keyboard navigation order of the browser.</p>
    <p>Consider the first case of changing a basic reading flow to circumvent (X)HTML  tabbing. A good example of this is a logical reading flow in a portal  with landmarks. In the future, the user may wish to change the reading  flow based on the order of priority with which they navigate a  personalized Web application<!-- like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">   MySpace</a> or <a href="http://my.yahoo.com/">MyYahoo</a>-->.  In the following example, the navigation would follow the order of "Top  News Stories", "television listings", "stock quotes", and "messages  from friends" by following (X)HTML document reading order. However, the author or end user may determine that the main content is most  important, followed by "stock quotes", "messages from friends", and  then "TV listings."  The end user can change the order if the web page or assistive technology provides an interface for such personalization.</p>
    <pre class="example highlight">&lt;html&gt;  
&#8230;  
&lt;div role="main" title="Top News Stories" id="main" aria-flowto="stock"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;div role="complementary" title="television listings" id="tv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div role="complementary" title="stock quotes" id="stock" aria-flowto="messages"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div role="complementary" title="messages from friends" id="messages" aria-flowto="tv"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  </pre>
    <p>The  second use case is such that the Web developer may wish to circumvent  the flow by branching to multiple paths in the Web page, requiring the  assistive technology to present a collection of options where the user  could go next. This is important for work flows or business process  management applications<!-- as shown in this <a href="http://www.skelta.com/products/screenshot-gallery/screens.aspx#ProcessDesigner">Process Designer Tool</a>-->.  More of these applications are becoming Web based, and a vehicle is  required to tell the user how to get through the work flow. The flowto  property takes multiple idrefs, allowing the author to define each  object the user could flow to. To implement this technique do the  following. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p id="step1_obj_accessible">Make each object in the work flow accessible</p>
        <p>This  will require assigning a title or WAI-ARIA label for each object and a  unique HTML id. Also, if the html element is repurposed assign it a  WAI-ARIA role. </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;html&gt;

&#8230;  
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="331" title="What is the Invoice Value?"&gt;  
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="333" title="Finance Manager Approval"&gt;  
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="334" title="Sales Manager Approval"&gt;  
&#8230;  </pre>
      </li>
      <li id="step2_flowto">Assign the flowto properties
        <p>For each visual object that will flow to one or more other objects assign  the flowto property the list of IDs to which it flows. </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;html&gt;  
&#8230;  
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="331" title="What is the Invoice Value?" aria-flowto="333 334"&gt;  
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="333" title="Finance Manager Approval"&gt;  
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="334" title="Sales Manager Approval"&gt;  
&#8230;  </pre>
<p>Each element referenced by the flowto must have have a unique id. The combination of the unique id and the name allow the assistive technology  to adequately assist the user in retracing their steps backward through a flow to reference or moving forward to it. Since the author sets only the target the user agent is responsible for mapping the backward reference relationship. Therefore, neither the user agent nor the user can get lost. The host user agent does not provide an alternative navigation order; this is an assistive technology function.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="step3_keyboard">Make sure visual objects are keyboard accessible
        <p>Use tabindex to enable objects to receive focus. Actually setting focus to them may be performed by an assistive technology, such as an alternative input device. This example places each drawing object in  document order with respect to the tab sequence. </p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="331" title="What is the Invoice Value?"
    aria-flowto="333 334" tabindex="0"&gt;
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="333"  title="Finance Manager Approval" tabindex="0"&gt;
&lt;img src="foo.jpg" id="334" title="Sales Manager Approval" tabindex="0"&gt;
&#8230;  </pre>
        <p>When  an assistive technology encounters "What is the Invoice Value?," it  will know to tell the user that they may choose to navigate either to  the "Financial Manager Approval" or to the "Sales Manager Approval"  object. The options may be provided through a menu for the What is the Invoice Value object by the assistive technology. After a choice  is made, then the AT can  move focus to the target object; or in  the case of a screen reader, it may just move the user to that location  in the screen reader's virtual buffer. </p>
        <p>Note:  WAI-ARIA does not specify backward flowto properties for the same reason  that we do not have the reverse of relationships like labelledby. The  author may incorrectly do the reversal, creating a whole set of new  problems. Rather, the task of the reversal relationships may be handled  by the user agent through its accessibility API mapping or in the  assistive technology itself.</p>

		<p>The following html fragment shows the use of <span class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</span> with a menubar, its menus, and submenus. All of the menuitems associated with the menubar have <span class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</span> set to 'true'. Also, the "Zoom" menuitem of the "View" menu has an <span class="property-reference">aria-haspopup</span> property as it leads to a submenu.</p>
		
		<pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="menubar"&gt;
  &lt;!--
    File menu: File menuitem has an aria-haspopup attribute set to 'true'.
    That popup div follows immediately below.
  --&gt;
  &lt;div role="menuitem" <em>aria-haspopup="true"</em> id="fileMenu"&gt;File&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div role="menu" aria-labelledby="fileMenu"&gt;
    &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;Open&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;Save&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;Save as &#8230;&lt;/div&gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!--
    View menu:
  --&gt;  
  &lt;div role="menuitem" <em>aria-haspopup="true"</em> id="viewMenu"&gt;View&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div role="menu" aria-labelledby="viewMenu"&gt;
    &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;Normal&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;Outline&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;!--
      The View's Zoom menuitem has aria-haspopup='true' as it leads to a
      submenu.
    --&gt;
    &lt;div role="menuitem" <em>aria-haspopup="true"</em> id="zoomSubMenu"&gt;Zoom&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div role="menu" aria-labelledby="zoomSubMenu"&gt;
      &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;50%&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;75%&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;100%&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;150%&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div role="menuitem"&gt;200%&lt;/div&gt;

    <h3> Managing Content and Presentational Changes </h3>
    <p>General rules for managing content and displaying information</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not change an element's role once it has been set. If you need to change the role of an object, first remove the element from the DOM tree and then add the new element to the tree with the new role set. </li>
      <li>For supporting browsers, tie CSS attribute selectors to WAI-ARIA properties to reduce script (browser issue with refresh).</li>
      <li>Tie CSS <code>display</code> property to WAI-ARIA hidden state. This is important for assistive technologies who communicate directly with the user agent's DOM versus a platform accessibility API supported by the user agent. You can also tie <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/visufx.html#visibility">CSS <code>visibility:hidden</code></a> or <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/visufx.html#visibility">visibility:collapse</a></code> to the WAI-ARIA hidden state but the use of <code><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/visufx.html#visibility">visibility:hidden</a></code> will affect layout in that content will continue to flow around the hidden area even though the content to be hidden is invisible. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are refreshing areas asynchronously, then you need to designate live regions. The following sections explain how to implement live regions and when to use roles that are considered "live" sections by default, including alert, status, or log.</p>
  </section>
    <section id="LiveRegions">
    <h3> Implementing Live Regions </h3>
    <p><a href="#attrs_liveregions" class="specref">Live regions</a> are parts of a Web page that the author expects to change.  Examples of live regions include dynamically updated  content (sports stats, stock information), logs where new information  is being added (chat transcript logs), notification areas (status,  alerts), etc. </p>
    <p>Live  regions enable assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to be  informed of updates without losing the users' place in the content.  Live region settings provide hints to assistive technologies about how  to process updates. Note that the assistive technology is responsible  for handling these updates and enabling users to override these hints. </p>
    <p>The section on <a href="#liveprops">Live Region Properties</a> and how to use them gives the details of how to apply live region properties. This  process will help rich internet application (RIA) developers to set  live region settings that will provide a good user experience for  most assistive technology users with little configuration on their  part. When applying these live region properties, it is recommended that you conduct user testing. If the <abbr title="assistive technology">AT</abbr> supports scripting of the response to live regions you may wish to customize the response, such as through a screen reader script for your Web page.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Identify the live regions</strong></p>
        <p>Live regions are any region on a page that receives dynamic updates through client-side scripting. Note the regions of your page that will be live. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>See if any of the special case live regions meet your needs</strong></p>
        <p> WAI-ARIA provides a number of <a href="#chobet">special case live region roles</a> whose live region properties are pre-defined and which you may use. If one of these live region roles meet your needs just apply the specific role to the region of the Web page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Decide the priority of each live region</strong></p>
        <p>When a live  region changes, should the user be notified of the change?  Notifications could include a sound for a screen reader user. (For  simplicity, we will use the case of an audio notification in this  discussion.) The shorter the interval between changes and the less  important the information, the less likely that the user needs to hear  every change. A simple example of changes that should not be heard are  changes to time; a sound for every second would be very annoying. </p>
        <p>If  the user should hear the change, should the change be announced  immediately, as soon as possible, or only when the user is idle?  Announcing a change immediately can be disorienting for users, so that  should be done sparingly. Most updates should probably only be  announced when the user is idle. </p>
        <p>After you have decided the priority for each live region, then decide the <em>live</em> property value: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Never spoken, then <code><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a>="off"</code> </li>
          <li>Spoken when user is idle, then <code><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a>="polite" </code></li>
          <li>Spoken as soon as possible, then <code><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a>="assertive"</code> </li>
          <li>For more specifics, see <a href="#liveprops" title="Live Region Properties">Live Region Properties</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Decide how much context is needed for each update</strong></p>
        <p>When part  of a live region changes, how much context is needed to understand the  change. Does the user need to hear the entire live region or just the  change by itself? </p>
        <p>If the user needs to hear the entire live region, then mark the entire live region with <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-atomic">aria-atomic</a>="true". </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Decide what types of changes are relevant for each live region</strong></p>
        <p>Three possible types of changes are: additions, removals, and text. <em>Additions</em> means new nodes are added to the DOM; <em>removals</em> means nodes are removed from the DOM; and <em>text</em> means changes are solely to the textual content. Should the user hear all types of changes or only certain types? </p>
        <p>By  default, the user will hear additions and text type changes. If you  wish to explicitly define the types of changes, you need to set  relevant="THE_TYPES_OF_CHANGES". If more than one type of change is  relevant, the types are separated by a space. For example, to define  additions and removals as relevant but not text, set  relevant="additions removals". </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
      <section id="liveprops">
      <h4> Live Region Properties and How to Use Them</h4>
      <p>One of the  most important concepts behind live regions is politeness. Politeness  indicates how much priority a live region has. The following politeness values are available for <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a>: off, polite, and assertive.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a>="off"</dt>
        <dd>This is the  default. Any updates made to this region must not be announced to the  user. live="off" would be a sensible setting for things that update  very frequently such as GPS coordinates of a moving vehicle.</dd>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a>="polite"</dt>
        <dd>Any updates  made to this region should only be announced if the user is not  currently doing anything. live="polite" should be used in most  situations involving live regions that present new information to  users, such as updating news headlines.</dd>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a>="assertive"</dt>
        <dd>Any updates  made to this region are important enough to be announced to the user as  soon as possible, but it is not necessary to immediately interrupt the  user. live="assertive" must be used if there is information that a  user must know about right away, for example, warning messages in a  form that does validation on the fly.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>There are times to suppress AT presentation changes while a region is updating. For that you can use the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-busy">aria-busy</a> property.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-busy">aria-busy</a>="true"</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>To suppress presentation of changes until a region is finished updating or until a number of rapid-fire changes are finished, set <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-busy">aria-busy</a>="true" and then clear the attribute when the region is finished. While it is busy, the AT will track and collate the changes. It will finally speak the changes once the region is no longer busy.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>When a live  region is updated, the update can often be announced on its own and  still make sense. For example, if a news headline is added, it would  make sense to simply announce the headline. However, sometimes the  entire live region must be read in order to give the user enough  context to make sense of the update. For example, it would not make  sense to only give the current value of a stock without saying the name  of the stock. The atomic setting gives assistive technologies a hint  about which of these cases an update falls into. </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-atomic">aria-atomic</a>="false"</dt>
        <dd>This is the  default. It means that when there is a change in the region, that  change can be presented on its own; the AT should not present the  entire region. atomic="false" is generally a good idea as it presents  users with only changes and does not cause them to hear repetitive  information that has not changed. However, Web developers should take  care that the changed information, when presented by itself, can still  be understood and contextualized by the user. </dd>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-atomic">aria-atomic</a>="true"</dt>
        <dd>If atomic  is set to "true", it means that the region must be presented as a  whole; when there is a change, the AT should present the entire region,  not just the change. atomic="true" can make it harder for users to  understand changes as the changed areas are not presented  independently. atomic="true" can also be annoying as it can force users  to listen to repetitive information that has not changed. However,  atomic="true" is necessary in cases where the change, when presented by  itself, cannot be understood and contextualized by the user. Note that when aria-atomic="true", the AT will attempt to speak the atomic region only once when multiple changes occur in the same region and it hasn't been spoken yet. </dd>
      </dl>
      Not all  updates to a live region are relevant. For example, if the oldest  headline in a list of headlines is removed and a new headline is added,  the removal of the oldest headline is probably not important enough to  announce to the user. However, in a chat application, when a user  leaves the chat and their username is removed from the list of users,  that removal may be important enough to announce. The relevant setting  gives a hint about what types of changes are relevant and should be  announced. Any change which is not relevant will be treated as if the  region had live="off" and will not be announced. Multiple types of  changes can be listed as relevant; the types are separated by a space.  The default is relevant="additions text" and this is the most common use case. If the default is applicable to your application, you do not need to provide the relevant property explicitly.
      <dl>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-relevant">aria-relevant</a>="additions"</dt>
        <dd>Insertion of nodes to the live region should be considered relevant. </dd>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-relevant">aria-relevant</a>="removals"</dt>
        <dd>Removal of nodes to the live region should be considered relevant. 
          Often, removals are not relevant because nodes are removed to make space for new information - e.g. a log implemented as a table where items are taken off the top. However, in the case of something like a buddy list, it is relevant if a buddy is removed. It doesn't require the screen reader to speak the removal, but it notifies the screen reader that it could be useful to do so. Use of <code>aria-relevant="removals"</code> or <code>aria-relevant="all"</code> should be used sparingly. Notification of an assistive technology when content is removed may cause an unwarranted number of changes to be notified to the user. </dd>
        <dt><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-relevant">aria-relevant</a>="text"</dt>
        <dd>Changes to the textual content of nodes that already exist  in the live region should be considered relevant. Textual content  includes text equivalents, such as the <code>alt</code> attribute of images. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p> This example shows two live regions. If both regions update  simultaneously, liveRegionA should be spoken first because its message has a  higher priority than liveRegionB.      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div id=&quot;liveRegionA&quot; aria-live=&quot;assertive&quot;&gt;         
&lt;/div&gt;         
&lt;div id=&quot;liveRegionB&quot; aria-live=&quot;polite&gt;         
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

    <h3> Choosing Between Special Case Live Regions</h3>
    <p>You may wish to use a special live region role instead of applying live region properties. WAI-ARIA contains a number of standard roles which are by default considered "live" sections of your Web page. It is important to know when to use these and when to create a custom live region on your known. Here are some rules of thumb:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><a class="role-reference" href="#alert">alert</a> - You must use the <a class="role-reference" href="#alert">alert</a> role for  a one-time notification which shows for a period of time and goes away and is intended to alert the user that something has happened. The assistive technology should be notified by the user agent  that an alert has occurred, if your operating system supports this type of event notification. When choosing to use alert you should use the <a class="role-reference" href="#alertdialog">alertdialog</a> role instead if  something inside the alert is to receive focus. Both <a class="role-reference" href="#alert">alert</a> and <a class="role-reference" href="#alertdialog">alertdialog</a> appear to pop-up to the user to get their attention.</p>
      <p><a class="role-reference" href="#status">status</a> - You must use the <a class="role-reference" href="#status">status</a> role when you want to mark an area which is updated periodically and provides general status of your Web application. Changes in status are not typically announced automatically by an assistive technology. However, it is possible to configure some assistive technologies, such as a scriptable screen reader, to watch for changes in the status bar and announce them.  Using the status role is also important in that the user could always check the status section for changes in status on different Web pages. Many applications provide status widgets and they are often found, visibly, at the bottom of the application and contain a variety of widgets within it to convey status. The use of <a class="role-reference" href="#status">status</a> does not guarantee how the AT will respond to changes in the status. The author can still put live="off" or live="assertive" to influence the ATs treatment of the status. </p>
      <p><a class="role-reference" href="#timer">timer</a> - You must use a timer role when you want to mark an area which indicates an amount of elapsed time from a start  point, or the time remaining until an end point. The text encapsulated within the timer indicates the current time  measurement, and are updated as that amount changes. However, the timer value is not necessarily machine parsable.  The text contents <strong>MUST</strong> be updated at fixed intervals, except when the timer is paused or reaches an  end-point. </p>
      <p><a class="role-reference" href="#marquee">marquee</a>- You must use a marquee role when you need to mark an area with scrolling text such as a stock ticker. The latest text of the scrolled area must be available in the DOM. A marquee behaves like a <a href="#liveprops">live region</a>, with an assumed default <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a> property value of "polite."</p>
      <p><a class="role-reference" href="#log">log</a> - You must use log if you have a live area where new information is added, like a scrolling chat log of text. Unlike other regions, implied semantics indicate the arrival of new items and the reading order. The log  contains a meaningful sequence and new information is added only to the  end of the log, not at arbitrary points. If you have a chat text entry area you should indicate that it also controls the aria log aria like so:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">&lt;div contenteditable="true" role="log" id="chatlog"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;label id="gettext"&gt;Send Text&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;div aria-controls="chatlog" 
     role="textbox" 
     contenteditable="true" 
     aria-labelledby="gettext"&gt;
&lt;/div</pre>
        <p><a href="#attrs_liveregions" class="specref">live region</a> - If you have some other live area use case, WAI-ARIA allows you to mark an area using the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-live">aria-live</a> attribute. This accompanied by the collection of attributes which support the live property allow you to create your own custom live area on your Web page. For more details regarding live regions refer to the <a href="#LiveRegions">live region</a> section of this guide.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Live region roles that are applied to elements having strong native semantics are not mapped consistently to the platform accessibility API.  An example is the <code>TABLE</code> element.  It is recommended that authors apply live regions to <code>DIV</code> and <code>SPAN</code> containers.  For example: </p>
                    <pre class="example highlight">&lt;!-- Live region 'log' role used with TABLE element:  the 'log' role is not consistently mapped to platform AAPI. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Do not use. --&gt;
&lt;table role="log" &#8230; &gt;
  &#8230;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;!-- Wrap the TABLE element in a DIV with role 'log' instead: --&gt;
&lt;div role="log" &#8230; &gt;
  &lt;table &#8230; &gt;
    &#8230;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <h2>Presentation Role</h2>
  <p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from APG version 1.0 -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
  <p>This section describes the presentation role, including the conditions under which it is inherited by an element's children.</p>
    <section id="presentation_intro">
    <h3>Rationale</h3>
    	<p>Authors devote a good deal of effort to the appearance of their web pages, and this is especially true in the case of scripted web applications.  To this end authors employ various elements purely for visual presentation.  For example, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements are used for spacing and decoration; and <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s are used to create a column based layout.  Elements used strictly for presentation are semantically neutral and irrelevant in terms of accessibility.  It is necessary to mark such elements as presentational so that they do not appear in the <a href="#intro_treetypes" class="core-mapping">accessible tree</a> created by the user agent.  For example, a current technique used with spacer images is to provide blank <code>alt</code> text to indicate that the image is not meaningful.  User agents will not publish any information about images with blank <code>alt</code> text to the platform accessibility API.</p>
    <p>There are elements other than <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> that are used solely for visual presentation.  Any element is a potential candidate for presentation, and, if so used, these elements also need to be marked as semantically neutral.</p>
    <p class="note">It is important to separate content and presentation. CSS 3 has introduced new table layout functionality to allow a user agent to layout content using CSS. There are many advantages to using this feature of CSS such as browser style sheet caching and improved adaptability to mobile devices with limited screen real estate. There are, however, cases where presentational markup cannot be avoided. In such instances, authors are counseled to consult <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0">WCAG 2.0</a> for more detailed guidance.</p>
    <p>WAI-ARIA introduces the <a class="role-reference" href="#presentation">presentation</a> role as a general device for marking elements as presentational.  The <a class="role-reference" href="#presentation">presentation</a> role overrides the element's native implicit role, and informs the user agent to not publish the element to the accessiblity API.  In fact, the preferred way to mark <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements as decorative is to use a <code>role="presentation"</code> attribute instead of (or in addition to) an empty <code>alt</code> attribute.  Here is a code fragment sample:</p>
    
<pre>&lt;!-- [role="presentation"] informs the user agent that the spacer images are for layout only. --&gt;
&#8230;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Histories of Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;

    <h3>Inheritance of Presentation by Parent Element's Children</h3>
      <p>In general, the presentation role is not inherited by an element's children.  The exceptions are elements whose role entails that the element has <a href="#mustContain" class="specref">required owned children</a>.  Examples include the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element and <a class="role-reference" href="#list">list</a> role, and these exceptions are discussed further below.  For all other elements, only the element marked presentational is eliminated from the accessible tree.  Note, however, that its contents are published; in particular, the element's textual content is published, but any attributes of the element that may form a text-equivalent are not. For example, a header element with a presentation role would not appear in the accessible tree, but its text does.  An image with a role of presentation is not exposed in the accessible tree, nor is the contents of its <code>alt</code> attribute.  This is shown in the following code fragment:</p>
      
<pre class="example highlight">&lt;!-- 1. [role="presentation"] negates the implicit 'heading' role semantics but does not affect the contents. --&gt;
  
&lt;h1 role="presentation"&gt;Presentation role overrides Header role&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Another header&lt;/h1&gt;
  
&lt;!-- 2. [role="presentation"] hides the image from the accessibility API and does not publish the alt attribute contents. --&gt;
  
&lt;img role="presentation" alt="This text will not appear in the Accessibility API" src="&#8230;"&gt;
  
</pre>
      <p>The first header element is absent from the accessible tree for the above example, but its text appears.  The second header element is present as a <a class="role-reference" href="#heading">heading</a>.  The <code>img</code> element is not exposed at all:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>root
          <ul>
            <li style="list-style: none;">&#8230;</li>
            <li>[text] Presentation role overrides Header role</li>
            <li>h1
              <ul>
                <li>[text] Another header</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style: none;">&#8230;</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be aware that the markup <code>&lt;img role="presentation" alt="non-empty alt text"&#8230;&gt;</code> is in fact contradictory:  Declaring a role of presentation says that the image is for layout, is decorative and meaningless, whereas the non-empty alt text implies that the image is meaningful.  It is recommended that authors instead use empty <code>alt</code> text (<code>alt=""</code>) where they use <code>role="presentation"</code>.</p>
      <p>Earlier it was noted that the <a class="role-reference" href="#presentation">presentation</a> role is not generally inherited by an element's children.  The exception are roles that have <a href="#mustContain" class="specref">required owned elements</a>.  Examples include the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element, and the <a class="role-reference" href="#list">list</a> and <a class="role-reference" href="#tree">tree</a> roles.  A <a class="role-reference" href="#list">list</a> is required to have  <a class="role-reference" href="#listitem">listitem</a> children; a <a class="role-reference" href="#tree">tree</a>, <a class="role-reference" href="#treeitem">treeitem</a> children.  The <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element's child components are <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>.  These component elements would not appear in the markup without the enclosing <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> root element.  Thus, when a table is used for layout, it follows that all of its component elements are present in the markup for layout as well.  Since annotating all the required child elements with <code>role=&quot;presentation&quot;</code> is error prone and difficult to maintain, it is sufficient to mark the table root element as presentational.  The presentation role propagates to all the table component elements.  However, as before, the contents of the table elements do appear in the accessible tree.  Here is an example:</p>
        
<pre class="example highlight">&lt;!-- Layout table marked with [role="presentation"]. --&gt;

&lt;table role="presentation"&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Some text&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="www.somewhere.com"&gt;Link text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="meaningful.jpg" alt="meaningful image"&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>
    <p>All table specific elements (table, tr, td, etc.) are eliminated from the tree by inheriting the presentation role, but other elements and textual content in the table cells are exposed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>root
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style: none;">&#8230;</li>
          <li>[text] Some text</li>
          <li>p
            <ul>
              <li>[text] Paragraph</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>a
            <ul>
              <li>Link text</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>img
            <ul>
              <li> [name] meaningful image</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li style="list-style: none;">&#8230;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The same logic applies to other roles that have required owned children, such as a <a class="role-reference" href="#list">list</a>.  If the list's root element is declared presentational using <code>role="presentation"</code>, all of its <a class="role-reference" href="#listitem">listitem</a> elements inherit the <a class="role-reference" href="#presentation">presentation</a> role, and none of the list item elements appear in the accessible tree.  However, the contents of each list item, that is, other elements and textual content, <em>are</em> included in the tree. </p>
  </section>
    <section id="presentation_overrides">
    <h3>Overriding Presentation</h3>
    <p>The presentation role is overridden in some circumstances.  Recall that the presentation role informs user agents that certain elements are semantically neutral, and are irrelevant for accessibility.  If, however, there is an aspect of an element that makes it meaningful, it is no longer neutral, and cannot simultaneously be presentational.  The <a href="#include_elements" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings describes the cases</a> where this occurs:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>element is focusable.</li>
    <li>element has a global WAI-ARIA attribute, other than <a href="#aria-hidden" class="property-reference">aria-hidden</a>.</li>
    <li>element is referenced by another element's <a href="#aria-controls" class="property-reference">aria-controls</a>, <a href="#aria-describedby" class="property-reference">aria-describedby</a>, <a href="#aria-flowto" class="property-reference">aria-flowto</a>, <a href="#aria-labelledby" class="property-reference">aria-labelledby</a>, or <a href="#aria-owns" class="property-reference">aria-owns</a> property.</li>
    <li>element normally inherits presentation from a parent, but the element explicitly declares a role other than presentation.
      <ul>
        <li>E.g., a table cell, <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>, within a <code>&lt;table role="presentation"&gt;</code>, where that cell is marked with a button role: <code>&lt;td role="button" &#8230;&gt;</code> -- the cell has a role of button, not presentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These situations entail that the given element is semantically relevant and will appear in the accessible tree. Marking the element with a role="presentation" is an error, and user agents will ignore the presentation role in these cases.  Authors are advised to not mark an element with a role of presentation when it has any of the above properties; rather, to use a role that reflects the element's purpose.</p>

<h2>Form Properties</h2>
<p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from APG version 1.0 -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
<p>
This section identifies authoring practices for elements used as form elements.
</p>
<div id="use_invalid">
<h3 id="useinvalid">Use aria-invalid and aria-required To Improve Access to Forms</h3>
<p>
Until the introduction of WAI-ARIA's aria-invalid state and aria-required property, only presentational strategies have been available to Web content authors to indicate that certain form fields and controls are required or invalid. In applications, these states are only available through styling or varying markup, which is inconsistent, and therefore is inconclusive. In Web-based forms, fields required may be marked by an asterisk. Forms submitted with required data missing or improperly specified may be redisplayed with the unacceptable elements highlighted in red. The assistive technology user is poorly served by such imprecise methods, and all users confront inconsistent indicators for consistent situations.
</p>
<p>
The WAI-ARIA invalid state and required property provide:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A programmatic aria-required property that can be applied to a form element to indicate to an AT that it is required to complete the form.
</li>
<li>
A programmatic aria-invalid state that can be used to indicate which data fields have incorrect data to an AT so that the user knows they have entered invalid data. Invalid data is often rendered in red by HTML form developers.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alertmax">Alert the User When Maximum Length Value Is Reached</h3>
<p>When a text input field that has a maximum length value (or the host markup language's equivalent) receives focus, the value defined for 
"maximum length" should be communicated to the user. When text entry reaches that maximum length (or the markup language's equivalent), an alert (expressed in accordance with user preferences and capabilities) should inform the user that the maximum length for a given field has been reached. Such an alert can be expressed programmatically or, using as an aural icon, by using a WAI-ARIA alert; the user agent may alert the user through a system beep and by triggering the operating systems' "show sounds" facility. When maximum length (or the markup language's equivalent) is reached, the user must then be able to move to another form field in a manner consistent with tab-navigation for that document.</p>
</div>
<div id="focus_change">
<h3 id="auto_focus_change">Automatic Focus Changes</h3>
<p>Having a user agent automatically change focus in a form in response to user input can be advantageous in situations where that change saves the user keystrokes or on-screen keyboard interaction in order to manually move the focus from one field to another. However, as with form auto-completion, this type of text input event must be firmly under user control because this may not have been the user's intention and some users with disabilities may become disoriented such as those with sight impairments. Consider these cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a text input field that automatically moves focus to a new 
field when the value defined for "maximum length" (or the markup language's 
equivalent) is reached, the user must have the ability to suppress the change in focus. Otherwise, the user's assistive
technology may not be able to make the user aware of the error.</li>
<li>
A textarea field that has a scripted counter to display the number 
of characters entered or the number of characters available for input; 
in this case, the dynamic content (the character count) must be owned 
by the textarea as a live region, so that the user can keep either a 
running (real-time) account of how many characters are left for him 
to input or can obtain such information on user query.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="autosubmit">
<h3 id="form_autosubmit">Form Auto-submit</h3>
<p>Use caution when using automatic submission of a form without explicit user command or 
in response to a user-defined setting that permits such behavior, as 
expressed by the Priority 1 <abbr title="User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0">UAAG 1.0</abbr> Checkpoints 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/guidelines.html#tech-selection-focus-conventions">7.1</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/guidelines.html#tech-default-input-sensible">7.2</a> and 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/guidelines.html#tech-info-current-ua-config">11.1</a>. 
Unless the user has specifically chosen to set the user agent to allow auto-submission, authors are advised not to set onChange or onFocus events either to trigger submission of a form or to provide an auto-submission event upon 
completion of all or all required fields of a form or input 
field. </p>

	<p class="ednote">Editors' note: This section was added as part of disposition of comment 4, but is very incomplete.

  <h2> Drag-and-Drop Support </h2>
  <p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from APG version 1.0 -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
  <p>Drag-and-drop operations are a common feature of Rich Internet 
Applications (RIAs). Drag-and-drop features have traditionally 
challenged people with functional disabilities. These problems arise 
from the difficulty of manipulating the mouse, finding targets capable 
of receiving the object being dragged, and actually moving the object to 
the drop target. Screen readers and alternate input systems assist the 
user to some degree by allowing the user to simulate a click, drag, and 
release operation. It is then up to the user to find a target that, 
hopefully, will receive the object(s) being dragged. Additionally, the 
user may not be aware if the desired drop operation is supported or what 
source objects can be selected for dragging. The end result can be a 
very unproductive and frustrating experience.
 </p>
  <p>WAI-ARIA introduces two new <a href="#attrs_dragdrop" class="specref">Drag and Drop properties</a> that aide Web application authors with the drag and drop process, called <em>aria-grabbed</em> and <em>aria-dropeffect.</em> The property <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> is applied to the source(s) being dragged, while <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-dropeffect">aria-dropeffect</a> is applied to the target(s). Use of these  properties--combined with best practices for enabling the user to select the appropriate drag operations and for assigning appropriate keyboard operations for dragging and dropping--will vastly improve the accessibility of drag and drop functionality. The following steps will guide you through the process. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Identify draggable objects</strong></p>
      <p>Set the initial <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> state of all draggable interface objects. 
        Roles that typically support drag and drop operations are <a href="#listitem" class="role-reference">listitem</a> and <a class="role-reference" href="#treeitem">treeitem</a>. The default state for all  objects is assumed to be undefined, meaning that they are not draggable.  For objects that may be dragged, set the <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> state to "false".  This will allow assistive technologies to indicate which objects are draggable and potentially facilitate in choosing the objects to grab. </p>
        <p class="note">Objects that can be dragged need to have a determinable role. HTML tags such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>  provide no semantics, unlike <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>, and would require you to set the WAI-ARIA role attribute.</p>
      
      <p>This  step clearly marks elements that can be &quot;grabbed&quot; for drag-and-drop operation. Assistive technologies, such as screen readers or alternate  input devices, can help the user move focus directly to the grab-supporting objects without having to navigate through all the  elements and to guess which could be ready to initiate a drag operation.  Although not necessary, authors or intermediaries could use CSS to  highlight those elements that may be grabbed. At this point, qualified drop targets cannot be determined as they are determined based on the objects being dragged--which have not yet been selected.</p>
      <p>All grabbable objects must be  navigable using the keyboard. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Allow the user to initiate the appropriate drag operation using the keyboard</strong></p>
      <p>The author must provide a keyboard accessible way of selecting one or 
more elements to drag. It is recommended that the space bar be used for 
selection.  It is further recommended that <kbd>Shift+Space</kbd> be used to select 
multiple objects and define a contiguous set; and that control+space be 
used to define a noncontiguous set.  As each object is selected, its 
<a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> property must be set to "true", giving the ATs references as 
to what has been grabbed.  It is recommended that <kbd>Control+M</kbd> be supported 
to indicate that all objects have been selected for drag.</p>
<p class="note">
Selection of the objects to be dragged may differ depending on 
their type. For example, a list of emails might be selected one at a time or many at a time in contiguous or non-contiguous manner using the <kbd>Space</kbd> key as indicated above. However, text in 
a document might better be selected by positioning the cursor at the 
beginning of a word and holding down the <kbd>Control</kbd> key while using the 
right and left arrow keys to mark the letters you wish to move.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Mark the drop targets</strong></p>
      <p>When the user has completed selecting source objects to drag, you must indicate which targets may receive them by setting the <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-dropeffect">aria-dropeffect</a> properties on those targets. This will indicate to the assistive technology that all objects have been grabbed as well as what targets are capable of receiving the drop.</p>
	  <p>When using a mouse, users click, hold the mouse button, and drag the mouse when moving the selected objects, and, by implication, are no longer selecting them.  With respect to keyboard users, the previous section, Item 2, &quot;Allow the user to initiate the appropriate drag operation using the keyboard&quot;, recommends using Control+M to indicate the end of the selection phase.</p>
	  <dl>
  <dt>* copy:</dt><dd>A duplicate of the source object will be dropped onto the target.</dd>
  <dt>* move:</dt><dd>The source object will be removed from its original location and 
    dropped onto the target.</dd>
  <dt>* link:</dt><dd>A reference or short cut to the dragged object will be 
    created in the target object.</dd>
  <dt>* execute:</dt><dd>A function supported by the drop target is executed, using 
    the drag source as an input.</dd>
  <dt>* popup:</dt><dd>The author must provide a popup menu or dialog to allow the 
        user to choose one of the drag operations (copy, move, reference) and 
    any other drag functionality, such as drag cancel.</dd>
   <dt>* none:</dt><dd>no drop operation is supported. This is the default for all 
    objects.      </dd>
    </dl>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
&lt;div role="treeitem" aria-dropeffect="copy move popup"&gt;
</pre>

      <p>
        CSS may also be used to highlight the targets to show sighted users 
        which objects can receive a drop of the grabbed source(s). Any object 
        without an <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-dropeffect">aria-dropeffect</a> property set will have an assumed 
        aria-dropeffect value of "none." Any object with an <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-dropeffect">aria-dropeffect</a> value 
        of "none" is ignored by ATs in the drop operation.      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Implement keyboard functionality to assist the user and AT with 
executing the drop.</strong></p>
<p>After all objects have been grabbed, the author should provide standard 
keyboard accessible navigation (such as through tabbing) to enable the 
user to navigate to the desired drop target. To achieve this, you may 
optionally support <kbd>Shift+F10</kbd> to invoke a single select list of possible 
drop targets from which the user may choose a single drop target that, 
when selected, would move focus to that drop target.
Otherwise, you must provide a keyboard accessible way (through tabbing 
and arrowing) to allow the user to navigate to the drop target. The 
user's point of regard should be clearly visible during this navigation.</p>
<p>
When the user arrives at the drop target the author should provide a 
keyboard accessible way to drop the selected object(s) onto the target. 
<kbd>Control+M</kbd> should be used to provide the most intuitive type of drop, 
either copy, move, or a shortcut. In the case of only one 
drop operation available, the <kbd>Control+M</kbd> should be used to drop the selected object(s) 
onto the target.</p>
<p>
If drop target supports additional drop operations, then the  
author should provide a WAI-ARIA-enabled pop-up menu from which the user 
can choose supported operations from the list. A recommended way to 
invoke this menu is to use the <kbd>Shift+Control+M</kbd> key sequence when focus 
is on the drop target. Furthermore, the <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-dropeffect">aria-dropeffect</a> property should include "popup" in its list of values to indicate that a 
keyboard accessible menu is provided. After the user has selected an 
action from the pop-up menu, the menu must close, with focus returning 
to the drop target. If the user does not choose an action and instead 
presses the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key, the application must dismiss the menu, 
returning focus to the drop target.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Cancelling a drag operation</strong></p>
      <p>Users can cancel the entire drag operation at any time, with one exception, by pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key.  The one exception is when the drop operations pop-up menu is displayed (see previous step four above).  In this case, <kbd>Escape</kbd> simply dismisses the pop-up, and a second <kbd>Escape</kbd> keystroke is needed to cancel the drag operation.  When the drag operation is so cancelled, all <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-dropeffect">aria-dropeffect</a> properties are set to &quot;none&quot;, all grabbable objects' <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> properties are set to &quot;false&quot;, and keyboard focus returns to the  last grabbed source object. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Clean-up after drag/drop</strong></p>
      <p>Once  the drop has occurred, you should clean up the DOM as you would do for drag-and-drop operation. This should include setting:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>All  <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-dropeffect">aria-dropeffect</a> properties to &quot;none&quot; or remove them altogether.</li>
        <li>All <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> of draggable objects to "false".</li>
        <li>All objects that are not grabbable must either omit the <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> property or have an <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-grabbed">aria-grabbed</a> property set to &quot;undefined.&quot;</li>
        <li>Focus on the appropriate DOM element, and its role must also be determinable.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">Other methods of performing the same 
operation as drag-and-drop may be the best way to meet the accessibility 
requirements. As an example, when moving a mail message from the inbox 
to another folder, a list of those folders could be presented in a 
select list as an alternative to drag-and-drop.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Document non-recommended keyboard navigation</strong></p>
      <p>If the author must  use alternatives to the keyboard 
navigation  recommended  here, it should be documented on the page.</p>

  <h2>States and Properties, and Assistive Technologies</h2>
  <p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from APG version 1.0 -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
  <p>Assistive Technologies (AT) access WAI-ARIA state and properties via a platform accessibility API.  An example of such an API is Linux's AT-SPI.  The user agent is responsible for publishing WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties and relevant changes via the accessibility API.  For more information, see the <a href="#" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a> [[CORE-AAM]].</p>
  <p>With respect to desktop applications, the interaction between the platform accessibility API and an AT is bidirectional.  The application sends information to the AT using the accessibility API, and the AT can request a change in the accessible state of an application through the same accessibility API.  However, with respect to ARIA 1.0, the flow of information is one way only from WAI-ARIA to the accessibility API.  There is no provision, currently, to go the other way.  An AT cannot use an accessibility API to alter any WAI-ARIA information in the DOM.</p>
  <p>The reason is that there is no consistent cross-browser implementation of a mutation event that web applications can rely on to detect when a WAI-ARIA state or property has changed.  Web applications use WAI-ARIA information for rendering their components.  For example, if the web application includes a DHTML checkbox as part of its interface, then the web app renders the visual appearance of the checkbox based on its aria-checked state.  If an outside agent were to change the state of that checkbox without the web app receiving any notification, then the checked state of the checkbox is no longer in agreement with its visual appearance.  It is likely that the behaviour of the web app will suffer.</p>
  <p>W3C is investigating device-independent interfaces to allow web applications to receive notification of changes to WAI-ARIA states and properties.  When this is available, WAI-ARIA will be bidirectional with respect to the platform accessibility API, allowing Assistive Technologies to alter WAI-ARIA states and properties.  Even so, the set of states and properties that an Assistive Technology is likely to change is limited to the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>aria-activedescendant</li>
    <li>aria-expanded</li>
    <li>aria-grabbed</li>
    <li>aria-selected </li>
    <li>aria-sort</li>
    <li>aria-valuenow</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following States and Properties are unlikely to be manipulated by an assistive technology: An AT would need to have greater understanding of the application and the results could be adverse.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>aria-atomic</li>
    <li>aria-autocomplete</li>
    <li>aria-busy</li>

    <h2>Background on WAI-ARIA</h2>
    <p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from the ARIA 1.0 Primer -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
    <p>According to the <a href="http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.200607/techpen.html">SecuritySpace Technology Penetration Report</a>, more than 55% of all Web sites today contain JavaScript,  dramatically affecting the ability for persons with disabilities to  access Web content. New Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) render custom  widgets, modeling rich desktop components to perform UI updates  without having to reload the entire page - much like a graphical user  interface (GUI). Legacy GUI accessibility frameworks address these  issues through a comprehensive accessibility application programming  interface (API) and infrastructure to foster interoperability with  assistive technologies. These APIs constitute a contract between  applications and assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to  enable them to access rich dynamic content with the appropriate  semantics needed to produce a usable alternative. No such contract  exists between modern RIAs and assistive technologies, creating an  accessibility gap for persons with disabilities.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, HTML and other markup languages do not provide adequate
      support for accessible dynamic content. Until now, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> has discouraged the use of JavaScript per [[WAI-WEBCONTENT]], Checkpoint 6.1). 
      A
      number of W3C initiatives  underway address this problem using
      a declarative markup approach. This primer describes a means to 
      bridge the interoperability problem with assistive
      technologies now by incorporating the appropriate metadata into
      current HTML and XHTML markup to support today's accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>s. Moreover, the primer provides web developers with a conceptual understanding of WAI-ARIA as a prelude to using the [[WAI-ARIA]]. WAI-ARIA brings advanced accessibility features of the desktop to the web through the  creation of cross-cutting technologies that
      (X)HTML authors can incorporate in their markup. WAI-ARIA defines roles, states, and properties, where those roles reflect standard GUI elements that are recognized by accessility Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These metadata that describes these
      GUI widgets and document structures aides assistive technology
      vendors in providing accessible, usable solutions. The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> <abbr title="Process and Formats">PF</abbr> working group is working with User Agent manufacturers, assistive
      technology vendors, and accessibility tool providers, to ensure an end-to-end working solution.</p>
    <p>For an introduction to WAI-ARIA, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php">Accessible Rich Internet   Applications Suite (WAI-ARIA) Overview</a>.  The WAI-ARIA Primer is part of a set of resources that support the WAI-ARIA specification. The Primer provides a basic introduction to the concepts behind and reason for WAI-ARIA, and the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices describe recommended usage patterns for Web content developers. The WAI-ARIA Suite fills gaps identified by the [[WAI-ARIA-ROADMAP]].  These documents serve as important places of clarification where topics appear to be unclear.</p>
    <section id="problemstatement">
      <h3> The Problem</h3>
      <p>Aspects of traditional Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) make accessible support of dynamic content difficult:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Accessibility of dynamic content relies on abstracting semantics from both content and  presentational information. Extracting semantic cues from current HTML  content is typically unreliable as the cues are limited to tag  elements names. </li>
        <li>While HTML allows content to be repurposed for presentational formatting, it lacks the ability to attach meaningful metadata about document structure and to convey semantic information. A common example of this is content formatted with tables rather than style sheets. </li>
        <li>When combined with script and cascading style sheets (CSS), HTML can be repurposed to create dynamic custom components without providing a means to convey semantic  information to native accessibility architectures designed to support  dynamic graphical user interface (GUI) content. </li>
        <li>Custom components built from common HTML elements often are not keyboard accessible. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Authors of JavaScript-generated content do not want to limit themselves to using standard tag elements that  define the actual user interface element such as tables, ordered lists,  etc. Rather, they make extensive use of  elements such as <code>DIV</code> tags in  which they dynamically apply a user interface (<abbr title="user interface">UI</abbr>) through the use of style sheets and  dynamic content changes. HTML <code>DIV</code> tags provide no semantic information.  For example, authors may define a <code>DIV</code> as the start of a pop-up menu or  even an ordered list. However, no HTML mechanism exists to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify the role of the <code>DIV</code> as a pop-up menu </li>
        <li>Alert assistive technology when these elements have focus </li>
        <li>Convey accessibility property information, such as whether the pop-up menu is collapsed or expanded </li>
        <li>Define  what actions can be formed on the element other than through a  device-dependent means through the event handler type (onmouseover,  onclick, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In short, JavaScript needs an accessibility architecture to write to such that a solution can be mapped to the accessibility
        frameworks on the native platform by the user agent.</p>
      <p>The following diagram illustrates a typical document object model (<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>) node in
        a Model-View-Controller architecture. Accessibility information surfaced to assitive technologies is provided only by the HTML element's tag name, with only the accessibility attributes that tag can provide.</p>
      <p><a href="#fig1"></a> shows that on the node, data, or the
        "Model", which should include semantic information, is separated
        from the user interface presentation, the "View." Here, the
        document element is managed by the user agent based on the default
        behavior of the element. The user agent's default behavior at the
        document element forms the controller. </p>
      <figure id="fig1">
        <img alt="Accessibility infomation mapped to a DOM element in the Document Object Model" height="512" longdesc="#desc_fig1" src="img/accessibleelement.png" width="640"/> 
        <figcaption>Accessibility Interoperability at a <abbr title="document object model">DOM</abbr> Node without JavaScript</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p id="desc_fig1">The box between the DOM node
        and the assistive technology contains the contract
        provided by the user agent to the assistive technology. This data
        includes typical accessibility information found in the
        accessibility API for many accessible platforms for GUIs
        (role, state, caret, selection, text, hypertext, name
        description, parent/child information, parent/child
        information, and relations). For HTML and other W3C markup, the
        accessibility information provided solely depends upon what the element's tag name and any accessibility attributes that map to that tag provides. For  example, the accessible role of a table is <code>table</code>. The author provides  an accessible description by assigning a <code>title</code> attribute.</p>
      <p>In contrast, with JavaScript, user actions can trigger updates in the data and presentation, but the default accessibility information available in the element tags is no longer valid.</p>
      <figure id="fig2"><img alt="DOM Element with JavaScript controller" height="502" longdesc="#desc_fig2" src="img/accessibleJSelement.png" width="476"/>
        <figcaption>Accessibility
        Interoperability at a DOM Node with JavaScript</figcaption></figure>
      <p id="desc_fig2"> <a href="#fig2"></a> shows the same DOM node provided
        in Figure 1.0 but with JavaScript acting as the new controller.
        JavaScript overrides the default user agent behavior at the DOM
        node. It manipulates the data, content, and style in response to
        events caused by user interaction to produce custom widgets. In
        this situation, the default accessibility information is no longer
        valid and, therefore, the contract is now invalid. Figure 2.0 shows
        the contract with asterisks in front of role, state, actions,
        value, event changes, and relations. These asterisks represent
        potential accessibility errors and gaps in the base markup. These
        gaps result from the author's inability to provide the new semantic
        data needed to support the contract.</p>

      <h3> Solution</h3>
      <p>What is clear from the problem statement is that developers of dynamic web content cannot provide the appropriate accessibility  information in the markup to support the accessibility APIs on the  target platform. This problem is not limited to HTML. It extends to  other markup, including <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">Scaleable Vector Graphics</a> [SVG]. This primer addresses the problem for  web content delivered to desktop browsers and introduces you to common extensions to both HTML and XHTML called [[WAI-ARIA]].

		Formats working group's primary focus is on extensions to HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.X by extending the host language to include WAI-ARIA with a migration path to HTML 5. This will require the creation of new hybrid document type definitions (DTDs) that incorporate the extensions.  This work will be in the [[WAI-ARIA]] specification. WAI-ARIA will constitute
		extensions  to fill most of the gaps needed to support
		accessibility API infrastructures and dynamic (X)HTML content. The   comprehensive gap analysis of (X)HTML, used to form WAI-ARIA is found in <a href="#t1">Table 1.0</a> and how WAI-ARIA fills those gaps. In the future we hope to incorporate WAI-ARIA into many host languages to improve their accessibility. The critical extensions needed to make accessible dynamic Web content accessible, through rich interoperability with assistive technologies,
		are summarized here: </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p> States, and Property attributes - This is the set of attribute  modifications to (X)HTML necessary to provide full keyboard focus and states and properties that may be mapped directly or indirectly to platform accessibility APIs to ensure full interoperability with assistive technologies for WAI-ARIA. </p>
		<p>Role  attribute - The role attribute, borrowed from the, [[ROLE-ATTRIBUTE]], allows the  author to annotate host languages with machine-extractable semantic  information about the purpose of an element. It is targeted for accessibility, device adaptation, server-side processing, and complex  data description. WAI-ARIA uses the role attribute to provides the role information, in <a href="#fig2"></a> to an assistive technology.</p>
		<p>Role document landmark values - These values, borrowed from the [[ROLE-ATTRIBUTE]] provides a standard set of role attribute values designed to define pertinent parts  of a document (landmarks) for the purpose of accessibility. User agents may  incorporate device equivalents, such as key mappings in the  case of a desktop user agent, to navigate to these sections of a  document.</p>
		<p>Taxonomy of WAI-ARIA role values - The necessary core roles found in Accessibility API sets
			for Windows and Linux as well as roles  representative of document structure, such as <a class="role-reference" href="#banner">banner</a> or <a class="role-reference" href="#treegrid">treegrid</a>. Use of document
			structure is necessary for assistive technologies to navigate
			complex documents and to know when they have entered active areas
			of a Web page such as in the case of a dynamic scripted Web
			application. The taxonomy  is designed to help user agents or
			authoring tools determine what properties a given role supports and to assist with accessibility API mapping of these
			properties. The taxonomy will is like a class hierarchy used to
			convey semantics and structure and includes  knowledge about each
			role. At this time, that taxonomy is modeled using [[RDF-CONCEPTS]] and [[OWL-FEATURES]]. </p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>In short, WAI-ARIA will be used to fix the dynamic accessibility of scripted Web content,
		in particular the use of JavaScript with (X)HTML markup. They are meant to be
		cross-cutting and should apply to other markup like SVG.  Less
		critical for (X)HTML but helpful for accessibility
		will be the descriptive extensions to XML events and the new [[XHTML Access]]. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> calls for the WAI-ARIA properties in guideline 4.1 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#ensure-compat">Maximize compatibility with current and future agents, including assistive technologies</a> (roles, states, properties, and values) and section guideline 1.3 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation">Create  content that can be presented in different ways (for example spoken  aloud, simpler layout, etc.) without losing information or structure</a> (relationships).</p>
	<p> The
		next section  describes how the specifications are used together as well as how they will be implemented in HTML 4.</p>
    <section id="new_provisions">
		<h3> Use of New Provisions for Keyboard Focus and Semantics to Support Platform Accessibility APIs</h3>
		<p>Adaptive technologies, which need to provide alternative access to
			complex user interfaces authored via HTML, are often left guessing
			at the semantics behind specific portions of HTML document. As an
			example, an XHTML document might use a certain HTML construct, such
			as a collection of <code>DIV</code> tags, to create navigation bars, a
			site-navigation menu, and other GUI-like user interface widgets. To
			fix the problem, we incorporate the role
			attribute, assign the accessible state properties, and give the object
			focus using the new <code>TABINDEX</code> feature. Addition of this information
			helps authors to provide the necessary information to
			enable the user agent to support the accessibility API accessed by
			the adaptive technology.</p>
      <section id="role">
			<h4> Provision of the Role Attribute: "What is the Object?"</h4>
			<p>Each platform accessibility API has the notion of a "role" for a
				GUI object. This is the case for [[JAPI]], [[MSAA]]], [[AXAPI]], and the [[ATK]], or [[UI-AUTOMATION]] (called content type in UI Automation). The WAI-ARIA specifications are based on XHTML 1.X and include the role attribute. The "role" attribute takes a qname, enabling authors to reference the role attribute from the WAI-ARIA Roles. In
				the following example, we use qname to reference the menu role  in the WAI-ARIA specification. </p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>Example: Use of WAI-ARIA to  incorporate
						role information into XHTML 1.x</p>
				<pre class="highlight">
<span class="pi">&lt;?xml version="1.1" encoding="us-ascii"?&gt;</span>
<span class="doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "Accessible Adaptive Applications//EN" 
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;</span>

&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div role="menu"&gt;
            File
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
			</div>
			<p>WAI used RDF/OWL to model our taxonomy for WAI-ARIA. In fact, if a host language sought to use namespaces or qnames, they could do so to reference the WAI-ARIA role taxonomy. The WAI-ARIA role taxonomy could be used by authoring tool developers to ensure that states and properties assigned to a given role are accurate.</p>
		</section>
      <section id="properties">
			<h4> Provision of the Accessibility State Information: "What meaningful properties does this object have at this time?"</h4>
			<p>Since this is dynamic content, the state of these new repurposed
				objects will change. The WAI-ARIA specification shall provide the common
				accessible properties needed to support the accessible state or
				property information provided by the platform accessibility API
				defined previously. This specification was created based on an
				analysis of the accessibility properties defined in <abbr title="Microsoft Active Accessibility">MSAA</abbr> and <abbr title="Accessibility Toolkit">ATK</abbr>.
				The following example extends the previous approach by adding the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-haspopup">aria-haspopup</a> accessibility property.</p>
			<div class="example">
				<p>Example: Use of WAI-ARIA to incorporate accessible state information information into XHTML 1.x</p>
				<pre class="highlight">
<span class="pi">&lt;?xml version="1.1" encoding="us-ascii"?&gt;</span>
<span class="doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "Accessible Adaptive Applications//EN"

&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;div role="menu" aria-haspopup="true"&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
			</div>
			<p>A Windows user agent may now map this property to the Microsoft
				Active Accessibility state of <code>STATE_SYSTEM_HASPOPUP</code>. Adding or
				removing this state would result in the Windows user agent sending
				an <code>EVENT_OBJECT_STATECHANGE</code> event to the assistive technology. The
				task of the JavaScript page author would be to maintain this state
				attribute, which can easily be done through the use of Document
				Object Model calls.</p>
		</section>
      <section id="focus">
			<h4> Provision of the Keyboard or Input Focus: "What object am I working on?"</h4>
			<p>Virtually all adaptive technology solutions, such as screen
				readers and onscreen keyboards, must know which object currently
				has focus. For example, an author might want to insert text into the
				current object with focus or to announce information
				about the object that has focus. With today's HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.x, script authors can only provide focus to form
				and anchor elements yet the Document Object Model Specification
				allows all elements to receive events including keyboard events.
				This means that HTML, by design prohibits script authors from
				making all HTML elements keyboard accessible. This single problem
				effects usability of Web pages where one gains access to
				elements by using the Tab key on desktop browsers. This slow,
				unproductive, approach makes portal navigation difficult because all active elements must be tabbed through to put focus on an
				active element in the last portlet in a document. To solve this
				problem in XHTML 1.x, we are incorporating a feature in Firefox and
				Internet Explorer to define the tabindex for -1. This allows a script author to
				give an element focus without placing it in the tab order: The
				following table describes these changes that will be incorporated
				into the new Accessible Adaptive Application specification.</p>
			<table>
				<caption>
				Accessible Adaptive Application Changes to Support Use of <code>tabindex</code> to give Element Focus
				</caption>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>tabindex attribute</th>
						<th>Focusable with mouse or JavaScript via element.focus()</th>
						<th>Tab navigable</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>not present</td>
						<td>Follows default behavior of element (yes for form controls,
							links, etc.)</td>
						<td>Follows default behavior of element</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Negative, e.g. <code>tabindex="-1"</code> </td>
						<td>Yes</td>
						<td>No, author must focus it with <code>element.focus()</code> as a
							result of arrow or other key press</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Zero, e.g. <code>tabindex="0"</code> </td>
						<td>Yes</td>
						<td>In tab order relative to element's position in document</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Positive, e.g. <code>tabindex="33"</code> </td>
						<td>Yes</td>
						<td>Tabindex value directly specifies where this element is
							positioned in the tab order. These elements will be positioned in
							the tab order before elements that have tabindex="0" or that are
							naturally included in the tab order (form elements and links)</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

			<p>The following example shows the introduction of <code>TABINDEX</code> to
				provide focus to a <code>DIV</code> having the new accessibility meta data:</p>

			<h4> Supporting WAI-ARIA in XHTML and HTML 4.01</h4>
			<p>Unlike XHTML, HTML 4.01 is non-extensible in that it is not possible to extend HTML 4 through the use of namespaces. That said, members of the working group have worked with the HTML working group to agree on  a vehicle that does not use namespaces, which at this time is supported by XHTML and HTML which will be supported in  HTML 5 when it becomes recommendation. Firefox 3 is leading the way to implement this, and other browser manufacturers are working to support it as well. The technique allows all role values specified in WAI-ARIA (including those specified by the XHTML Role attribute module) to be specified without a namespace prefix. Additionally, WAI-ARIA states and properties shall be represented as aria- followed by the concatenated WAI-ARIA state or property. </p>

		<h3> Use of XHTML Role Landmarks to Improve Document Navigation</h3>

			incorporate device equivalents, such as key mappings in the case of
			a desktop user agent, to navigate to these sections of a document
			independent of the Web site. The addition of these semantics allows

			document sections. This is especially important for portals to
			improve the usability. These may be used as attributes in XHTML 1.x

		<h3> WAI-ARIA Role Taxonomy  - Extensible Semantic Role Model, using RDF/OWL</h3>
		<p>The WAI-ARIA role taxonomy was modeled using semantic web technology, in the form of [[RDF-CONCEPTS]] and the [[OWL-FEATURES]], as a vehicle to define a knowledge-based class hierarchy  for roles. This model shows what states and properties are supported, by each role in the taxonomy. The role in the class hierarchy inherits properties from its ancestors and defines its own properties. Where applicable, semantic web technology is used to define related concepts within other namespaces. This information is critical in determining how to choose a role and how to interact with it. The role taxonomy uses RDF as a way for using data to describe data and provides a
			W3C standards-based approach to represent this information.</p>
      <figure id="fig4">
			<!-- <embed src="resourcemap.svg" width="810" height="800"> -->
			<img alt="Sample Semantic Map for Taxonomy" height="564" longdesc="#desc_fig4" src="img/taxonomy.png" title="Sample Semantic Map for Taxonomy" width="500"/>
			<figcaption>Example, Partial RDF Map for a possible ButtonUndo role as an extended role to  WAI-ARIA</figcaption>
      </figure>
		<p id="desc_fig4"> <a href="#fig4"></a> shows a basic RDF mapping that
			defines a set of terms and relationships defining an object. At the
			center is a Widget object that defines common states and properties
			for all GUI widgets. The Button object extends Widget and inherits
			defined accessibility properties from the superclass Widget. It
			also defines a <em>relatedConcept</em> property to a Link object.
			The ButtonUndo role extends Button. It has a relatedConcept of an HTML input object.
			ButtonUndo will introduce Dublin Core meta data such as the
			description of the object. The terms relatedConcept and
			requiredState are terms that will be defined as part of the
			corresponding RDF schema. Each role instance will represent
			standard Roles found in the platform accessibility APIs of platforms like
			Windows and Gnome as well as content structure. These roles will
			form the taxonomy. Although host language browser implementations may reference WAI-ARIA roles without namespaces, the  RDF representation for a given role may be referenced using a
			qname from a Host XML markup language. This examples shows an XHTML reference to a grid role in the RDF representation of the WAI-ARIA taxonomy:</p>
		<p><code>&lt;div
			role="grid"&gt;</code> whereby <code>grid</code> expands to:
			http://www.w3.org/2005/01/wai-rdf/GUIRoleTaxonomy#grid in the
			button markup.</p>
		<p>The power of this design is that it enables a web authoring tool to go back
			into the corresponding RDF/OWL markup and determine what properties it
			supports for Accessibility API mapping. Additional, middleware solutions can now make intelligent
			transformations of Web Content by processing the semantics behind
			rich browser and rich structured frameworks to adapt accessible
			solutions for a broader user base. Our immediate goal is to fix the
			accessibility problem with scripted Web content. Assistive
			technologies will use the standard roles to determine how to render
			most content. </p>
      <section id="temp">
			<h4> Interoperability  Example: Grid Role </h4>
			<p>To understand the power of this approach, consider the case of a Grid Role, analogous to a table. <a href="#fig5"></a> shows a DHTML example  using
				XHTML, JavaScript, and CSS to produce a GUI-like application. This
				example developed in IBM shows a notebook
				tab with a data grid that behaves like a traditional desktop GUI.
				The user uses arrow keys to navigates the data grid and among the page tabs.
				Using the Tab key, a user navigates between the notebook tab, the edit fields, buttons, and
				the data grid.</p>
        <figure id="fig5"><img alt="DHTML example of GUI-like notebook tab with a data drid" height="633" longdesc="#desc_fig5" src="img/DHTMLexample.png" title="DHTML Example" width="844"/>
				<figcaption>DHTML Example</figcaption>
        </figure>
			<p id="desc_fig5"> Accessible role and state
				meta data from the WAI-WAI-ARIA Roles, States, and Properties specification,  are added as attributes to
				each of the XHTML elements repurposed as GUI widgets dynamically.
				The user agent, in this case Firefox, maps this information to the
				platform accessibility API. <a href="#fig6"></a> shows
				the Microsoft Active Accessibility rendering of the new
				accessibility markup provided on the DataGrid page tab which has
				focus.</p>
        <figure id="fig6"><img alt="MSAA Inspect Tool diagnostics for Notebook page tab" height="647" longdesc="#desc_fig6" src="img/inspectofpagetab.png" title="MSAA Inspect Tool diagnostics for Notebook page tab" width="490"/>
				<figcaption>Microsoft Inspect Tool rendering of the page tab
				DataGrid</figcaption>
        </figure>
			<p id="desc_fig6"> <a href="#fig6"></a> show a Microsoft Inspect 32
				rendering of the DataGrid Page page tab in Figure 5.0. Inspect32
				provides Microsoft Active Accessibility information; here it shows the
				accessible role of "page tab" and accessible state information of
				focused, focusable, and linked. There are no page tab elements in
				XHTML. Here, an XHTML DIV element is repurposed by a
				JavaScript controller to look like a notebook tab. It is now able
				to receive focus, unlike in standard XHTML 1.X, and it does so without
				requiring tabbing. With these specifications, the script
				author can now add the accessibility properties to support platform
				accessibility API. Accessible state properties for the DataGrid
				page tab are shown as focused, focusable, and linked. Unlike a GUI
				application,  authors need only enable their applications once for
				multiple operating system platforms.</p>
			<p>Beyond scripted Web content, the working group intends to extend
				the use of roles to enable other user cases. These may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> <strong>Structured Textual Markup</strong> - enhancing
					structure of the markup of a document, including Data Tables , or
					translating the structure of an XML document to a markup structure 
					that user agents are used to dealing with (e.g. myXML to XHTML)
					Binding sections of a document to a common role. This allows for
					different navigation techniques though a document</li>
				<li> <strong>Knowledge representation of Web content</strong> - As a
					secondary benefit, roles improve compatibility with Knowledge-Based
					Services and the Semantic Web. By integrating accessibility and the
					semantic Web, accessibility can be moved forward, paving the way
					for customized accessible searches and intelligent user agents with
					additional applications.</li>
				<li> <strong>Adding concepts in the type of content for adaptation
					to the user scenario</strong> - The more that is understood about
					content, the better it can be adapted for the end user. For example:
					<ol>
						<li>If it is known that a page hyperlink has the role of taking the
							user to the site's home page, then that knowledge can be used to
							create enhanced accessibility in different ways in many different
							scenarios, such as icons or access keys.</li>
						<li>If it is known that a text box is for the user email address,
							then the user agent can support users filling in the form by
							labeling it with an icon or symbol, automatically validating it, or
							even form filling.</li>
						<li>If it is known that a paragraph is complex, then a simple equivalent
							can be shown in its place</li>
						<li>If a word is ambiguous, then a role of a concept can be given,
							providing clarity An example of this may be : <code>&lt;span
							role="role:nonliteral" aria:hasAlternate="no"&gt;</code></li>
					</ol>

		<li>Each <a href="#dfn-element" class="specref termref">element</a> or <a href="#dfn-widget" class="specref termref">widget</a> has correct and complete <a href="#dfn-semantics" class="specref termref">semantics</a> that fully describe its behavior (using element names or roles);</li>
		<li>The <a href="#dfn-relationship" class="specref termref">relationships</a> between elements and groups are defined;</li>
		<li><a href="#dfn-state" class="specref termref">States</a>, <a href="#dfn-property" class="specref termref">properties</a>, and container relationships are valid for each element's behavior and are accessible via the [[dom]] and the platform <a href="#dfn-accessibility-api" class="specref termref">accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr></a>; and</li>
		<li>Keyboard focus should be maintained for the duration of the user's interaction with the application.</li>
		<li>All interactive components should be <a href="#dfn-keyboard-accessible" class="specref termref">keyboard operable</a>.</li>
	</ol>
  	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> provides authors with the means to make the different elements in a web application semantically rich. <a href="#dfn-user-agent" class="specref termref">User agents</a> use the role semantics to understand how to handle each element. Roles convey additional information that the <a href="#dfn-assistive-technologies" class="specref termref">assistive technologies</a> need to anticipate the behavior of the elements inside the application such as how to present the corresponding <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties to the user. The user agent will use the accessibility semantics from the host language and WAI-ARIA accessibility semantics (which may augment or override those of the host language) and present them to assistive technologies through the Document Object Model or the platform accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>. The user agent will create an accessible representation of each element in the web page, and will use the appropriate accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr> to notify assistive technologies of changes to the semantics of those elements.</p>
	<p>The following steps are recommended when <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is applied to content:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Use native markup when possible.</strong></p>
			<p>Use the semantic elements that are defined in the host markup language. For example, with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, it is better to use the native checkbox than to use a div element with role <code class="role-reference">checkbox</code> as these should already be accessible through your browser. There may also be cases where <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can augment an existing element in the host language. For example, a <code class="role-reference">grid</code> and <code class="role-reference">gridcell</code> elements can reuse the functionality of a table when overlaying it. <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles, states, and properties are best used when the markup language does not support all the semantics required. When a role <a href="#dfn-attribute" class="specref termref">attribute</a> is added to an element, the semantics and behavior of the element are augmented or overridden by the role behavior.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Apply the appropriate roles.</strong></p>
			<p>Set roles to make sure elements behave predictably and correctly describe the behavior of each element within the application, unless element behaviors are fully described by the native markup language. Roles for interactive elements should support all the attributes that the element could use. Once a role attribute is set it should not be changed as this may confuse the end user. This does not preclude an element being removed which has the role attribute set, but only states and properties (aria-* attributes) should be changed for a given element.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Preserve semantic structure.</strong></p>
			<p>Structural information is critical to providing context to persons with disabilities. Preserve DOM hierarchy within structural elements and widgets: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>	Form logical groups within user interface widgets, such as treeitem elements in a group. </li>
				<li>	Identify large perceivable regions and apply a <span class="role-reference">landmark</span> role to those areas. This will facilitate keyboard navigation. It will also facilitate content management by assistive technologies by providing semantics to manage how much information is rendered at a given time. The use of WAI-ARIA landmarks helps everyone, including vision-impaired users, dexterity-impaired users, and even users with cognitive or learning impairments.</li>
				<li>	For areas of the page that contain a group of elements that are likely to change through an Ajax application it may be specified as a live region, through the use of the aria-live attribute or it may be marked with pre-defined roles, such as <span class="role-reference">log</span>, which has assumed behavior of a live region. </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Build relationships.</strong></p>
			<p>Look for <a href="#dfn-relationship" class="specref termref">relationships</a> between elements, and mark them using the most appropriate <a href="#dfn-property" class="specref termref">property</a> or attribute. For example, if a page contains both a search form and search results region, mark each container as a <code class="role-reference">region</code> and set the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> attribute of the search form to reference the search results. See <a href="#attrs_relationships" class="specref">relationships in <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr></a>.</p>
			<p>Some relationships are determined automatically from the host language, like <code>label</code> elements associated with <code>input</code> elements in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Set states and properties in response to events.</strong></p>
			<p>Once the role for an element has been set, change states and properties as appropriate during the element's life cycle, usually in response to user input <a href="#dfn-event" class="specref termref">events</a>. Only use attributes supported for the chosen role or element.</p>
			<p>User agents should notify assistive technologies of state changes. Conversely, assistive technologies' notification of property changes depends on the method by which assistive technologies communicate with the user agent. For example, the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-multiline">aria-multiline</a> attribute (a property) is not something that changes frequently, whereas the <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-checked">aria-checked</a> attribute (a state) changes frequently in response to user input.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Support full, usable keyboard navigation.</strong></p>
			<p>Usable keyboard navigation in a rich internet application is different from the tabbing paradigm in a static document. Rich internet applications behave more like desktop applications where the user tabs to significant widgets and uses the arrow keys to navigate within a complex widget, such as a menu or spreadsheet. The changes that <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> introduces in keyboard navigation make this enhanced accessibility possible. Tabbing in the document should follow a logical navigation structure. Authors implementing arrow key navigation should, where possible, follow the design patterns in the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices Guide. When using these features, it is important as always to ensure keyboard navigation is logical.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><strong>Synchronize the visual interface with the accessible interface.</strong></p>
			<p>This will allow the state of your <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> to be <a href="#dfn-perceivable" class="specref termref">perceivable</a> to the user as well as assistive technologies. For example, the author should use the appropriate WAI-ARIA attribute on a form element that is visually styled to appear required (<code class="property-reference">aria-required</code>) or a gridcell that is visually styled to appear selected (<code class="state-reference">aria-selected</code>). Authors may choose to achieve visual synchronization of these interface elements by using a script or by using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/selector.html#attribute-selectors"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> attribute selectors.</a></p>

		<h3>Example: Building a Tree Widget</h3>
		<img alt="Graphic of an example tree view." class="role-screenshot" src="img/exampletree.png" width="188" height="327" />
		<p>A basic tree view allows the user to select different list items and expand and collapse embedded lists. Arrow keys are used to navigate through a tree, including left/right to collapse/expand sub trees. Clicking the visible expander button with the mouse also toggles expansion. Further keyboard implementation details for tree widgets may found in the <a href="#aria_ex"></a>.</p>
		<p>To make this feature accessible we need to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Inform <a href="#dfn-assistive-technologies" class="specref termref">assistive technologies</a> about the <a href="#dfn-role" class="specref termref">role</a> of each <a href="#dfn-element" class="specref termref">element</a>;</li>
			<li>Inform assistive technologies about the <a href="#dfn-relationship" class="specref termref">relationships</a> between tree items;</li>
			<li>Give a clear keyboard focus that will not confuse users with disabilities; and</li>
			<li>Expose the changing <a href="#dfn-state" class="specref termref">states</a> (expanded and collapsed) of the tree items.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Following the steps below:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Look at the native markup language</strong></p>
				<p>Although standard list behavior is supported by the native <code>ul</code> and <code>li</code> elements in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, there is no element that natively supports list expansion and selection. Since there is not, we will need to use <a href="#dfn-role" class="specref termref">roles</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Finding the right roles</strong></p>
				<p>Since there is no native tree element in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, we need to add roles from the <a href="#dfn-taxonomy" class="specref termref">taxonomy</a> that support the additional states and properties needed. The roles that support tree behavior are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code class="role-reference">tree</code>: A tree is the main container element for our tree. It is a form of a <code class="role-reference">select</code> where sub-level groups of treeitems may be collapsed and expanded.</li>
					<li><code class="role-reference">treeitem</code>: A treeitem is an option item of a tree. This is an element within a tree; sub-level groups of treeitems may be expanded or collapsed.</li>
					<li><code class="role-reference">group</code>: A group encloses a set of sub-level treeitems.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Look for groups and build relationships</strong></p>
				<p>Tree relationships can be made simply via the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and logical structure of the page. A tree element will be the main container encompassing all other elements in the tree. Each selectable item in the tree will be a treeitem.</p>
				<p>When a treeitem contains an embedded list of treeitems they will be all be embedded in a group. A group should be contained inside the tree item that is the parent item.</p>

      &lt;li role=&quot;treeitem&quot;&gt;Lettuce&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
				<p>The use of <code>aria-expanded</code> should mirror that which is visibly expanded on screen, so authors may wish to use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> attribute selectors to toggle visibility or style of an item based on the <a href="#dfn-value" class="specref termref">value</a> of an <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a href="#dfn-state" class="specref termref">state</a> or <a href="#dfn-property" class="specref termref">property</a>. The following example would hide the sub-level groups of a collapsed tree node.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight">[aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot;] [role=&quot;group&quot;] { display: none; }</pre>
				<p class="note">
					<!-- keep this note synced with other CSS examples using attribute selectors -->
					At the time of this writing, this <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> example, while technically correct, will not redraw styles properly in some browsers if the attribute's value is changed dynamically. It may be necessary to toggle a class name, or otherwise force the browser to redraw the styles properly.</p>
				<p>Sometimes a tree structure is not explicit via the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and logical structure of a page. In such cases the relationships must still be made explicit using the states and properties. In the following example, the <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-owns">aria-owns</a> attribute indicates that the <code>div</code> with id &quot;external_treeitem&quot; should be considered a child of the <code>ul</code> element with the attribute, even though it is not a child in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight">...
&lt;li role=&quot;treeitem&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;true&quot; aria-owns=&quot;external_group&quot;&gt;Vegetables&lt;/li&gt;
...
&lt;ul role=&quot;group&quot; id=&quot;external_group&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li role=&quot;treeitem&quot;&gt;Carrot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li role=&quot;treeitem&quot;&gt;Tomato&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li role=&quot;treeitem&quot;&gt;Lettuce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
...</pre>
				<p>Sometimes trees (and other lists or grids) cannot be completed represented in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> due to performance limitations of the browser. For example, an application interface may only need to display 100 items out of a set of 100,000. Including all 100,000 items in the DOM could cause performance problems on both the client and server machines.</p>
				<p>If items in a managed widget are loaded, for example, via the XMLHttpRequest object, and not present in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> at all times, authors should use <code class="property-reference">aria-level</code>, <code class="property-reference">aria-posinset</code> and <code class="property-reference">aria-setsize</code>, and  ensure that <code class="property-reference">aria-owns</code> is not required to convey membership with the widget.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight">...
&lt;li role=&quot;treeitem&quot; aria-level=&quot;1&quot; aria-posinset=&quot;3&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;true&quot; aria-setsize=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

	<h2> Reasons for Adopting WAI-ARIA </h2>
	<p class="note">This section has not been updated since it was integrated from the ARIA 1.0 Primer -- an APG taskforce review is pending.</p>
	<p>By adopting WAI-ARIA, both developers of static web  sites and of dynamic Internet applications can improve the usability, accessibility, and scalability of their products. Developers of  static web content can continue to follow the 1999 WCAG 1.0 standards, while improving usability and accessibility through the use of WAI-ARIA <a href="#landmark_roles" class="specref">landmark roles</a>, <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-labelledby">aria-labelledby</a> relationships, and  properties like <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-invalid">aria-invalid</a> and <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-required">aria-required</a> that can apply to HTML form controls. In richer, dynamic content, developers create custom widgets like calendars and spreadsheets based on technologies such as Ajax and CSS; to achieve accessibility, they need to use WCAG 2.0. Previously, when delivering rich Internet applications to users, to comply with WCAG 1.0, developers resorted to providing alternative, static content. While such measures met the WCAG 1.0 requirements,  people using assistive technologies were not provided the richer user experience. When tables are used for layout, rather than CSS absolute positioning, historically, they have been problematic for assistive technologies to interpret. When the WAI-ARIA role of <a class="role-reference" href="#presentation">presentation</a> is used on such tables, the assistive technology ignores the table structure, providing a more accessible experience without requiring major recoding. </p>
    <section id="tech_reasons">
		<h3> Technical Benefits </h3>
		<p>Consider a rich Internet application where developers   attempt to achieve keyboard accessibility using markup language. Without WAI-ARIA, results may be keyboard accessible but not highly usable; consider a user having to press Tab thirty times to put focus on a checkbox. To achieve keyboard accessibility in HTML without WAI-ARIA, developers must code active elements either as a link or as a form element. Accordingly, this means that no additional semantics are required or provided, other than that provided by the host language. In addition, WCAG 1.0 requires that content be renderable with Cascading Style Sheets turned off in the browser. This approach creates the following general usability problems:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All  keyboard-accessible controls must be either forms or anchors, forcing the user to tab through all focusable elements on the web page to navigate. If you need to navigate from the first link on the page to the last link on the page, that could be a very long trip and takes usability a step back.</li>
			<li>Without WAI-ARIA semantics, you cannot provide contextual information to the user. </li>
			<li> If you repurpose HTML elements you cannot provide the appropriate role and context information for the new widget. Lack of context is a serious usability problem. WAI-ARIA semantics results in providing contextual information to the user.</li>
			<li>CSS is used for absolute positioning. If you remove that capability, usability features of widgets like pop-up menus disappear. Imagine activating the file menu and the menu showing up at the bottom of the page. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>WAI-ARIA and WCAG 2.0 coding techniques are useful for developing content and applications that can scale across a variety of user agents, including those on mobile devices. </p>
		<p>For all these reasons, adopting WAI-ARIA makes good technical as well as business sense. For a further illustration, compare how accessibility is achieved with WCAG techniques without and with WAI-ARIA, as shown in <a href="#fig7"></a>. </p>
      <figure id="fig7">
        <!--<img alt="WAI-ARIA tree widget usability comparision" class="figure" src="img/style_aria.jpg" title="tree widget comparision"/>-->
        <p class="ednote">Editor's Note: Figure 7, described as WAI-ARIA tree widget usability comparision, refers to a resource that has not yet been found.</p>

		<!-- aria-describedby="ariausability" -->
		<p id="ariausability">
			<!-- role="description" -->
			<a href="#fig7"></a> shows an "accessible" widget for a tree item, within a tree widget, using WCAG 1.0 without WAI-ARIA, which ,when supplied to a screen reader, may say "link folder Year." There is no information to indicate that the folder is closed (<code><a class="state-reference" href="#aria-expanded">aria-expanded</a> = "false"</code>). There is no information to indicate its depth (<code><a class="property-reference" href="#aria-level">aria-level</a>="2"</code>), position in the set and the set size at the level, all of which provides the user with context something sighted users may take for granted. The role is used to indicate that it is a treeitem which indicates that the item should behave and navigate with the keyboard like a tree item. A screen reader using the WAI-ARIA version might say "Closed Folder Year, Closed Folder one of two, Depth two, unchecked." Furthermore, the WAI-ARIA version can allow the tree items to be navigated with arrow keys and without requiring they be navigated as part of a global web page tabbing scheme. This is not what any user would expect of a tree widget. Finally, if you were told all widgets were links on the web page, consider how usable -- or not -- that would be.</p>

    <section id="biz_reasons">
		<h3> Business Benefits </h3>
		<p>If, as described above, coding techniques to achieve accessibility compliance do not promote overall usability, then business strategists must ask <em>"Why invest in accessibility?"</em> With WAI-ARIA, businesses can invest in accessible development and reap benefits for all users, not just those with disabilities or using assistive technologies. Some benefits include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Because WAI-ARIA is being developed through the PFWG with cooperation from browser and assistive technology vendors, accessibility and interoperability with those technologies will be easier to achieve, reducing or eliminating the need for per-browser and per-screenreader coding to achieve accessibility. </li>
			<li>In addition to people with disabilities, all users benefit from WAI-ARIA because it establishes a Web-standard for keyboard interaction, easing the learning curve for users moving among applications, sites, and browsers. </li>
			<li>Implementing WAI-ARIA can facilitate test automation. Test engines require semantic information about user interface elements, unique names, exposure of state, specific properties in order to run automated test scripts. WAI-ARIA provides that semantic information needed for efficient  test automation.</li>
