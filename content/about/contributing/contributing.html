      <h2>Introduction  </h2>
      <p>
        Continuous improvement to the utility and quality of the APG depends on broad community input and participation.
        Anyone may contribute feedback, suggestions, or code via the channels described below.
        However, if you would like to contribute regularly, please consider
        <a href="#joining-task-force">joining the Authoring Practices Task Force</a>.
        As a Task Force participant, you and your organization have greater influence over APG development, and are listed as contributors where appropriate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="providing-feedback">
      <h2>Providing feedback</h2>
      <p>
        The APG provides two public feedback channels -- GitHub and email.
        Links to both are provided at the bottom of every page in the APG.
      </p>
      <p>
        GitHub issues are the best way to ask a question, make a suggestion,  or report a problem.
        Before creating a new issue, it is helpful if you first review existing issues to determine whether there is an issue addressing the same concern.
        If so, please comment on that issue rather than raising another.
        If the concern you would like addressed is related to an example implementation of an APG pattern, at the bottom of the page, next to the revision date, there is a link named "Related Issues".
        That link opens a GitHub project containing all issues associated with the relevant pattern and its examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/issues">View and create APG issues on GitHub.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The task force also uses the public aria-practices mailing list for email discussion.
        Meeting announcements, agendas, and links to minutes are sent to the mailing list.
        While GitHub issues are the preferred place to discuss APG content, the mailing list is available to anyone who would prefer to communicate by
        <a href="mailto://public-aria-practices@w3.org">sending email</a>.

      <h2>Helping provide assistive technology support data</h2>
      <p>
        The assistive technology support tables included on APG example pages, e.g.,
        <a href="../../patterns/radio/examples/radio-activedescendant.html#at-support">Assistive Technology Support for Radio Group Example Using aria-activedescendant</a>,
        are provided by the
