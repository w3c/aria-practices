      <h2>Other Ways to Contribute</h2>

      <h3>Raise a Github Issue</h3>
      <p>
        The APG Task Force uses github issues to manage the activities of the working group.  Creating an issue is the best way to ask a question or report problems with an example or other information in the practices.  Before creating a new issue, please review the current list of issues to see if your question has been asked or your problem reported.  If an issue already exists feel free to add your own comments to the issue.  New issues are reviewed in the weekly APG meetings.
