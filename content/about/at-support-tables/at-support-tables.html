    <h1>Assistive Technology Support Tables</h1>
    <p>
      As the <a href="https://aria-at.w3.org/">ARIA and Assistive Technologies Project</a>
      makes reports on assistive technology interoperability for APG examples available,
      the APG Task Force adds summaries of assistive technology support to the relevant example pages.
      This page explains how to interpret and use the assistive technology support summaries.
    </p>

    <section id="purpose">
      <h2>Purpose of AT Support Tables</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the support tables is to provide an actionable summary of the interoperability tests performed by the <a href="http://aria-at.w3.org/">ARIA-AT project</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="meaning">
      <h2>Meaning of Support Levels</h2>
      <p>
        The assistive technology support tables present two percentages for each assistive technology and browser combination that have been tested: "Must-Have Behaviors" and "Should-Have Behaviors".
         A behavior designated as “Must-Have" is essential; if not provided, users could be blocked from using the UI element.
        Failure to provide a “Should-Have” behavior could impede users.

        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples of Must-Have Behaviors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convey the name of a radio button.</li>
          <li>Convey the state of a checked radio button.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples of Should-Have Behaviors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convey the position of a radio button in a radio group, e.g., the button is 1 of 3.</li>
          <li>Convey the number of radio buttons in a radio group.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Important Constraints</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Unless otherwise noted, all testing is done using the default configuration of an assistive technology.</li>
          <li>
            ARIA-AT interoperability  tests do not prescribe exactly how to satisfy a need.
            For example, they do not specify exactly what a screen reader should speak.
            Two different screen readers may convey the same information in different ways.
          </li>

      <section>
        <h3>Don’t Code to the Bugs</h3>
        <p>
          ARIA-AT is working with assistive technology vendors to increase their support levels.
          This means that assistive technologies that align with ARIA-AT interoperability tests will change over time.
          Exercise caution when implementing a pattern where support levels are less than 100%.
          Avoid modifying code to accommodate an assistive technology failure unless you are confident that the modification will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not negatively affect the experience when using assistive technologies that provide 100% support.</li>
          <li>Not negatively affect the experience when the failure being accommodated is resolved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When possible, test implementations of APG patterns with an assistive technology that provides 100% support for both must-have and should-have behaviors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Design Around Critical Support Failures</h3>
        <p>
          Where feasible, avoid implementing features of APG patterns where support for must-have behaviors is less than 100%.
          If the must-have support level is less than 100% for the example implementation of a pattern, that does not mean all variants of that pattern will present assistive technology users with critical problems.
          In these cases:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If there are multiple implementation examples of the pattern, compare support levels across examples to discover whether another method of implementation provides better support.</li>
          <li>learn about the specific aspects of an example implementation that are not fully supported by navigating to the detailed report with the View Complete Report button.</li>
            <li>If possible, use the guidelines of the pattern to design interactions such that they avoid the problematic features.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Perform Your Own Tests</h3>
        <p>
          A primary purpose of ARIA-AT data is to help assistive technology vendors coordinate interoperable rendering of ARIA.
          While the ARIA-AT summary tables on APG example pages can be used as a guide of where to prioritize testing, the data is not as a final verdict on whether a feature in a web application will work.
          It is essential  for all developers to test applications with multiple assistive technologies to ensure a good user experience.
