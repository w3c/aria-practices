      <h1>Change History</h1>
      <p>
          APG 1.1 supported ARIA 1.1, and this version, APG 1.2, includes changes to support version 1.2 of the ARIA specification.
          It also includes nearly 200 significant updates to improve the quality and breadth of content.
          A <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Change-Log-for-November-2021-APG-1.2-Note-Release-1">detailed log of all changes</a> is available on the wiki of the w3c/aria-practices GitHub repository.

      </p>
      <ul>

          <li>Revised guidance for roles where naming requirements changed in ARIA 1.2. ARIA 1.2 prohibits names on some roles. ARIA 1.2 removed naming requirements from some other roles.</li>

          <li>Added a design pattern and example implementation of the meter role, which is new in ARIA 1.2</li>
          <li>Added two examples that demonstrate how to create rating inputs, one based on slider and one based on radio group.</li>
          <li>Added two other slider examples: a vertical temperature slider and a media seek slider.</li>
          <li>Added a switch design pattern and three example implementations: one made from a div element, one based on HTML button, and one that uses HTML checkbox input.</li>
