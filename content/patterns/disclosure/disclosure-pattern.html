    <h2>About This Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      A disclosure is a widget that enables content to be either collapsed (hidden) or expanded (visible).
      It has two elements: a disclosure <a href="../button/button-pattern.html">button</a> and a section of content whose visibility is controlled by the button.
      When the controlled content is hidden, the button is often styled as a typical push button with a right-pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display additional content.
      When the content is visible, the arrow or triangle typically points down.
