        The code in this example is not intended for production environments.
        Before using it for any purpose, read this to understand why.

      <p>This is an illustrative example of one way of using ARIA that conforms with the ARIA specification.</p>

          There may be support gaps in some
          <a href="../../../practices/read-me-first/read-me-first-practice.html#browser_and_AT_support">browser and assistive technology combinations</a>,
          especially for
          <a href="../../../practices/read-me-first/read-me-first-practice.html#mobile_and_touch_support">mobile/touch devices</a>.
          Testing code based on this example with assistive technologies is essential before considering use in production systems.

          Robust accessibility can be further optimized by choosing implementation patterns that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1">maximize use of semantic HTML</a> and heeding the warning that
