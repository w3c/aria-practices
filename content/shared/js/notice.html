      There may be support gaps in some <a href="../../../practices/read-me-first/read-me-first-practice.html#browser_and_AT_support">browser and assistive technology combinations</a>, especially for <a href="../../../practices/read-me-first/read-me-first-practice.html#mobile_and_touch_support">mobile/touch devices</a>.
      Testing code based on this example with assistive technologies is essential before considering use in production systems.
